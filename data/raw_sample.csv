Google has struck deals with at least 24 big app developers to stop them from competing with its Play Store, including an agreement to pay Activision Blizzard about $360 million over three years, according to a court filing on Thursday.
Google also agreed in 2020 to pay Tencent Riot Games unit, which makes “League of Legends,” $30 million over one year in a similar deal, the filing stated.

The financial details emerged in a newly unredacted copy of a lawsuit “Fortnite” video game maker Epic Games first filed against Google in 2020 over allegedly anticompetitive practices related to the search giant’s Android and Play Store businesses.
Google, Activision and Riot did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the new filing. But Google has previously said the lawsuit is baseless and has taken business conversations out of context.
Epic last year mostly lost a similar case against Apple, the other leading app store provider. An appellate ruling in that case is expected next year.

Google agreed to a record $391.5 million privacy settlement with a 40-state coalition of attorneys general on Monday for charges that it misled users into thinking they had turned off location tracking in their account settings even as the company continued collecting that information.
Under the settlement, Google will also make its location tracking disclosures clearer starting in 2023.

The attorneys general said that the agreement was the biggest internet privacy settlement by U.S. states. It capped a four-year investigation into the internet search giant for violating the states’ consumer protection laws.
States have taken an increasingly central role in reining in the power and business models of Silicon Valley corporations, amid a vacuum of action from federal lawmakers.
More than four years after Europe rolled out data privacy rules for its citizens, Congress and regulators have failed to agree to a federal data protection law in the United States. Lawmakers have squabbled over details of privacy proposals, and tech giants have deployed armies of lobbyists to water down or destroy legislation.

Google parent Alphabet denied claims in an antitrust case in California federal court that the company had deleted employees’ electronic “chats” to deprive plaintiffs of evidence in their case alleging anticompetitive conduct within the Google Play Store.
Lawyers for Google at law firms Morgan, Lewis & Bockius and at Munger, Tolles & Olson in a court filing said the company had taken appropriate steps “to preserve and produce” evidence of employees’ internal chats. The company called the plaintiffs’ bid for sanctions “meritless” and asked US District Judge James Donato in San Francisco to reject the bid.

Donato is presiding over a series of related cases brought since 2020 by “Fortnite” maker Epic Games Inc, consumers and dozens of US states challenging alleged exclusionary practices in how Google runs its app store. Google has denied the claims.
Judges are regularly called on to referee pretrial fights over evidence, and parties can ask courts to impose sanctions on one side for not following rules.
Google has produced information including contracts, emails, transactional data and other records as part of the litigation.
Last month, the plaintiffs’ lawyers leading cases against Google jointly askedDonato to punish Google for the alleged destruction of “substantive” chat-related information relevant to the pending antitrust claims.
A Google spokesperson on Friday declined to comment about the dispute over chat evidence, and lawyers for plaintiffs did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

Google is “punishing Republicans” who speak out against Big Tech, according to the conservative Media Research Center, reported CNN.
MRC Free Speech America has conducted a series of studies related to Google’s treatment of Republicans ahead of the critical midterm elections. Despite Google’s vehement denials of any wrongdoing, the conservative media watchdog believes Google “does change its algorithm to benefit certain political candidates,” and is focused on the Senate because its “search bias” didn’t carry over to House races where the GOP is already favored.

The latest study focused on 10 key races in the House and Senate involving sitting lawmakers who have spoken out against Big Tech. MRC said its findings indicated Google “severely buried or did not even display several Republicans’ campaign websites” if they have acted aggressively toward Big Tech.
“In fact, the search giant completely hid six of 10 Republicans’ campaign websites from the first page of results,” MRC associate editor Brian Bradley wrote.
“Google did not show Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul’s campaign website on its front page of search results but showed his Democrat challenger Charles Booker’s campaign website as the first result. Paul, who is up for re-election, has been a frequent critic of Big Tech,” Bradley added. “Google buried [Colorado] Rep. Ken Buck’s campaign website as the 15th result out of 20 on the first page, while elevating his challenger Democrat Ike McCorkle’s campaign website to the No. 3 spot in the search results. Buck has introduced legislation that would strengthen antitrust actions brought against industries including Big Tech.”

5,"October 31, 2022",Supreme Court On Google Ruling May Reset Internet Content Rules,"


Tech industry players are concerned that the Supreme Court could impose new rules that upset the internet economy.
That’s according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, which looks at the court’s upcoming ruling on Section 230, a federal law that guards sites such as Facebook or YouTube against lawsuits over harmful content posted by third parties.
The case originated with a lawsuit against YouTube owner Google by the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, who was killed in the 2015 Islamic State terrorist attack in Paris. They argue that YouTube aided ISIS by recommending the group’s videos to users. Google says that Section 230 guards it against liability for content added to its site by users.

“This is going to be the most important [Supreme Court] term ever for the internet,” Alan Rozenshtein, a Justice Department cybersecurity official turned University of Minnesota law professor, told the WSJ. “It’s not even close.”
The tech industry has already begun to try to figure out its response to an unfavorable ruling, including petitioning Congress to pass legislation to rewrite Section 230 with more obvious liability protections, said Matt Schruers, president of the trade group Computer and Communications Industry Association.
“I could foresee an outcome where the litigation and compliance risks stemming from an ill-considered decision are so great that many small firms exit the market,” which would lead to foreign-based services picking up market share, he said. “To say that another way, US competitiveness is potentially at risk here, and we have the most to lose from getting this wrong,” Schruers said.

6,"October 30, 2022",Google To Appeal Indian Ruling Over Android,"


Google is planning a legal challenge to block a ruling by India’s antitrust watchdog to change its approach to its Android operating system, concerned that it will restrict how it promotes the platform, sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters.
The Alphabet Inc unit has been fined $275 million in two Indian antitrust decisions since last week – one for its policies of charging in-app commissions and another for abusing its position in the market for Android operating system.

The rulings come as Google faces increased antitrust scrutiny across the world. Last month, it suffered a major setback when a European court upheld a 2018 ruling saying it was largely confirming a decision that the company imposed “unlawful restrictions on manufacturers of Android mobile devices.” Google plans to appeal the decision, where it faces a record $4.1 billion fine.
The Competition Commission of India’s (CCI) Android ruling, despite involving a smaller $162 million fine, has worried Google since it seeks wider ranging remedial measures, three sources aware of company’s thinking said.
One of the sources said that Google was concerned that the CCI’s decision could increase regulatory pressures in other jurisdictions and a legal appeal to block implementation of the antitrust directive was being planned within weeks.
Google declined to comment on its legal plans, reiterating its statement from last week that the CCI order was “a major setback for Indian consumers and businesses, opening serious security risks … and raising the cost of mobile devices for Indians.”
Abhishek Manu Singhvi, lead counsel for Google in its arguments before the CCI, tweeted on Wednesday that “inherent & patent infirmities” in the order make a challenge inevitable and likely to succeed.

European antitrust regulators are investigating Google’s Play Store, the company said in a regulatory filing, a move that could expose the US tech giant to another billion-euro fine, reported Reuters. 
Over the last decade, Google has incurred 8.25 billion euros ($8.24 billion) in EU antitrust fines following three investigations into its business practices.

“In May 2022, the EC (European Commission) and the CMA (Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority) each opened a formal investigation into Google Play’s business practices,” Google said in a quarterly earnings filing dated Oct. 25.
The European Union antitrust watchdog did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
EU antitrust regulators are investigating whether Google’s threat to remove apps from its Play Store if app developers use other payment options instead of its own billing system has hurt the developers, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters in August.
Fees charged by Google and Apple at their mobile app stores have drawn criticism from developers who say they are excessive.
Separately, Google said on Thursday it will appeal its record 4.1-billion-euro ($4.10 billion) EU antitrust fine at Europe’s top court after a lower tribunal threw out its challenge last month.

8,"October 26, 2022",Google To Pay YouTube Creators In Bid Compete With TikTok,"


Calling it “a big deal” for creators, Google parent Alphabet said Tuesday it will pay top creative talent to post videos on its new YouTube Shorts platform as it aims to grab a bigger slice of a shrinking ad-spend pie while slowing the advance of rival TikTok.
By introducing the new revenue sharing plan, which it says will kick in early next year, Google becomes the fourth major player this month to announce a big move to boost the creator economy at a time when the real economy is, by most accounts, headed into recession.
“This update makes YouTube the only platform where creators can monetize their content across short, long and live formats at scale,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told investors on the company’s third quarter earnings webcast Tuesday (Oct 25) evening.
Related: Google & Youtube Hit With Patent Fine Over Video Sharing
The monetization move not only comes in the wake of related initiatives launched recently by Walmart, Meta and Instagram’s Reels, as well as a new payment program from Visa, but also reflects the changing media consumption habits that increasingly tight-fisted advertisers are looking to capture.
Given that 80% of Alphabet’s revenues come from advertising, and three-fourths of that come from Google Search alone, it’s fair to say that the company’s $54 billion exposure to online ad spend in Q3 — and in turn, the pulse of the global economy — is second to none.
As a result, news that the search giant saw its Q3 sales growth slow to 4% from a blistering 43% pace a year ago did not sit well with already-weary investors, who are growing tired of seeing sales and profits decline while costs and headcount continue to rise — all while the stock has lost more than 30% so far this year.
Officially, Alphabet said its employee base rose about 25%, ending the quarter at 187,000 from 150,000 in 2021.
“In the third quarter, we did see a pullback in spend by some advertisers in certain areas and search ads,” Alphabet Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler told investors Tuesday (Oct 25) evening, pointing to weak spending in financial services generally — and a pullback in insurance, loan, mortgage and crypto subcategories specifically — as indicative of the broader trend.
“There’s no question we’re operating in an uncertain environment and that businesses big and small continue to get tested in new and different ways,” Schindler added, noting that alongside Shorts, the company’s YouTube TV unit was adding subscribers and viewing hours at an unmatched — and almost unfathomable — clip.
On average, Schindler said, global viewers are watching more than 700 million hours of YouTube content on TV daily, with another 30 billion daily views on Shorts via a base of 1.5 billion monthly active users.
“TV is a big area for us,” Pichai said. “Nielsen reported that YouTube was the leader in streaming TV viewership in the US in September for the first time,” he added, speaking to what Schindler characterized as strong engagement driven by a “streaming boom.”

Germany’s antitrust watchdog said on Monday it had expanded two probes into US e-commerce giant Amazon making use of new regulation allowing it to prohibit any anti-competitive behaviour at an earlier stage, reported Reuters.

Changes to Germany’s antitrust laws for digital corporations, which came into effect last year, give the cartel office more power in identifying and prohibiting some companies’ dominant positions.
According to the cartel office, Amazon operates the most important marketplace in e-commerce, giving it a key position in that area that allows it to set the rules for competition on its platform.
“Our new competencies, which are precisely intended to restrict such power to set rules, allow us to intervene more efficiently against Amazon’s anti-competitive practices,” Mundt said.

Apple and Amazon were accused in an antitrust lawsuit on Wednesday of conspiring to drive up the prices of iPhones and iPads. The lawsuit claims that Amazon and Apple colluded to eliminate third-party sellers on Amazon who offered these products at a lower price. 
The lawsuit was filed by law firm Hagens Berman in Washington. It alleged that the companies had an ‘unlawful horizontal agreement’ to reduce the ‘competitive threat posed by third-party merchants’, thus violating the US antitrust laws that prohibit such coordination, especially when it leads to higher prices or other harms to consumers, such as loss of quality or access.

The lawsuit claimed that Amazon expelled third-party sellers after it signed a deal with Apple in 2019. The number of Apple resellers on Amazon fell to around 20 per country, according to reports. Apple, in return, gave Amazon up to a 10 percent discount on its products. Based on a MacRumors report, there were about 600 third-party sellers of Apple devices on Amazon, but only seven were left following the 2019 agreement.  
The change transformed Amazon into the dominant reseller of new iPhones and iPads. According to a Reuters report on the lawsuit by plaintiff Steven Floyd of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, prices rose more than 10 per cent, while Apple stabilised the prices it charged in retail stores.

Amazon is facing a $1 billion class action lawsuit in the UK, where the company has been accused of using a “secretive” algorithm to abuse its dominant position in e-commerce.
Amazon harms its customers by directing them to its “featured offer,” resulting in better-value deals being hidden and consumers ending up paying more for products, according to the suit, which is expected to be filed with the Competition Appeal Tribunal in October.
The suit alleges Amazon exploits its so-called “Buy Box” to steer shoppers toward its own products and items from third-party sellers who use its order fulfillment and delivery services.
Related: Italian Court Overturns Apple & Amazon’s Antitrust Fine
The Buy Box is an area on Amazon’s product pages that gives customers a one-click option to “Buy Now” or “Add to Basket.” Amazon sets certain criteria for sellers to become Buy Box eligible and, if accepted, they gain placement advantages for their listings.
It adds that Amazon uses a “secretive and self-favouring algorithm to ensure that the Buy Box nearly always features goods sold directly by Amazon itself, or by third-party retailers who pay hefty storage and delivery fees to Amazon.”
The litigation is being led by Hausfeld, a specialist law firm. Between 80% to 92% of Amazon purchases are made on its Buy Box tool, according to Hausfeld.
Anyone who lives in the U.K. and made a purchase on Amazon since October 2016 falls under the claimant class, Hausfeld added.
Hausfeld estimates total damages from the litigation in the region of £900 million ($1 billion) if it succeeds. Julie Hunter, an independent consultant, is the lead representative.
“Millions of consumers have paid too much and been denied choice. This action seeks fair redress for them,” said Lesley Hannah, one of the Hausfeld partners leading the litigation. “Amazon takes advantage of consumers’ well-known tendency to focus on prominently-placed and eye-catching displays, such as the Buy Box.”
“Amazon doesn’t present consumers with a fair range of choices – on the contrary, the design of the Buy Box makes it difficult for consumers to locate and purchase better or cheaper options,” Hannah added. “Amazon should not be allowed to take advantage of its customers in this anticompetitive way.”

Canada’s Federal Court has ruled to allow a proposed class action lawsuit against Amazon to go to arbitration after finding the e-commerce giant entered into binding agreements with buyers.
In Difederico et al. v. Amazon.Com, Inc. et al., Stephanie Difederico brought a proposed class action lawsuit against Amazon, alleging that the company has participated in criminal price-fixing, violating the Competition Act through competetive pricing provisions and a related fair pricing policy.
The case adds to the growing list of challenges to Amazon’s policies regarding third-party sellers, and other price-fixing accusations that have been brought against the retail giant in several jurisdictions, including the EU, India, and the US.

The Federal Court noted that the Supreme Court of Canada has consistently held that courts should give effect to arbitration agreements absent any legislative intervention. There is also a well-settled policy in Canada that compliance with arbitration agreements should be enforced by the courts to ensure that such agreements are not null, void, inoperative, or incapable of performance.

An administrative court in Italy today scrapped a €173.3 million ($170.4 million) fine leveled at Apple and Amazon last year for alleged anti-competitive cooperation when selling Apple and Beats products, Reuters reports.
In November 2021, Italy’s antitrust watchdog hit Apple and Amazon with a $196 million fine in the culmination of an investigation that began in 2020 over allegations that the two companies had been blocking the sale of Apple and Beats devices to resellers in order to stifle competition and keep prices high.
The regulator said contractual provisions of a 2018 agreement between the two companies meant only selected resellers were allowed to sell the products on Amazon’s Italian store, which was in violation of EU rules and affected competition on prices.
Amazon was fined €68.7 million euros ($67.6 million), while Apple received a fine of $132.3 million. The watchdog also ordered the companies to end the restrictions to give retailers of genuine Apple and Beats products access to the Italian Amazon web store in a “non-discriminatory manner.”
Both Apple and Amazon appealed against the fines. “To ensure our customers purchase genuine products, we work closely with our reseller partners and have dedicated teams of experts around the world who work with law enforcement, customs and merchants to ensure only genuine Apple products are being sold,” Apple said, denying any wrongdoing. In a separate statement Amazon said it strongly disagreed with the decision of the Italian authority and that the proposed fine was “disproportionate and unjustified.”
Earlier this year, the fine was reduced to an overall €173.3 million ($170.4 million) due to a “material error” in the initial calculation. Amazon welcomed today’s ruling in a statement, while Apple and Italy’s antitrust regulator declined to comment.

Media regulators are looking into whether large US tech companies including Amazon and Google have formed a monopoly over cloud computing in Britain, officials said Thursday.
Britain’s media watchdog agency Ofcom announced the investigation and said it will look into whether the two companies and Microsoft may have an unfair competitive advantage in the cloud services industry.
“Because the cloud sector is still evolving, we will look at how the market is working today and how we expect it to develop in the future — aiming to identify any potential competition concerns early to prevent them becoming embedded as the market matures,” the agency said in a statement, according to the Evening Standard.
Specifically in the crosshairs of the inquiry are Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, all of which dominate global cloud storage services — a powerful tool that allows businesses to store data on remote servers accessible from anywhere as opposed to localized hard drives.
Depending on the findings of the investigation, the agency could take further action to rein in the corporate behemoths.
Other popular digital tools are also on the watchdog’s radar, including Meta’s WhatsApp, Apple’s Zoom and FaceTime and virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa — services that so far have seen little, if any, regulatory oversight.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and CEO Andy Jassy must testify in a Federal Trade Commission probe into whether the company misled people into subscribing to Amazon Prime and other services, the FTC said Wednesday.
Last month Amazon asked the FTC to cancel subpoenas issued to Messrs. Bezos and Jassy, arguing that they aren’t steeped in the details of Prime’s sign-up and cancellation processes, reported The Wall Street Journal.  The FTC’s staff began the probe in March 2021, examining whether the company deceived customers into signing up for Prime and didn’t provide a simple way to cancel the program’s recurring charges, according to the order issued Wednesday.
But agency commissioners said Amazon had not met the legal threshold to quash the civil subpoenas issued to the two men. 
“Amazon provides no reason why the Commission must accept anything less than all the relevant testimony it can obtain from these two witnesses,” FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson wrote in Wednesday’s order.
In a statement, Amazon said it is “disappointed but unsurprised the FTC largely declined to rule against itself, but we’re pleased that the agency walked backed its broadest requests and will allow witnesses to choose their own counsel.”
“Amazon has cooperated with the FTC throughout the investigation and already produced tens of thousands of pages of documents,” the company said. “We are committed to engaging constructively with FTC staff, but we remain concerned that the latest requests are overly broad and needlessly burdensome, and we will explore all our options.”
The requirement that Amazon’s most powerful leaders testify to the FTC underscores the depth and breadth of the agency’s investigation, which covers a sweeping range of Amazon services.

24,"September 13, 2022",Plaintiffs Question Scope Of Facebook’s $90M Privacy Settlement,"


A group of plaintiffs’ lawyers has raised questions about the scope of Meta’s pending $90 million privacy settlement in California federal court, telling a judge that their allegations in a separate antitrust case should be carved out and not swept up into the deal.
The attorneys at Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro and Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan said in a court filing on Monday they were concerned that broad language in the privacy settlement could be used to thwart pending antitrust claims in front of another judge in California’s Northern US District Court.
The privacy settlement would resolve claims that Facebook tracked users’ web activity even after they had logged out of the social media website. In the antitrust case, Facebook is accused of exploiting user data to curb competition. The case also involves the company’s data collection practices.
The data privacy settlement announced in February “risks providing a benefit to common defendant Meta Platforms Inc for which it did not bargain and to which it is not entitled,” lawyers for the antitrust plaintiffs said in Monday’s court filing.
The plaintiffs’ attorneys asked US District Judge Edward Davila to include a sentence in the privacy settlement that says the resolution of the dispute does not limit the claims alleged in the antitrust litigation.

Meta Platforms’s Facebook has in-principle agreed to settle a lawsuit in the San Francisco federal court seeking damages for letting third parties including Cambridge Analytica access the private data of users, a court filing showed.
The financial terms were not disclosed in the filing on Friday that asked the judge to put the class action on hold for 60 days until the lawyers for both plaintiffs and Facebook finalize a written settlement.
The four-year-old lawsuit alleged that Facebook violated consumer privacy laws by sharing personal data of users with third parties such as the now-defunct British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.
Facebook has said its privacy practices are consistent with its disclosures and “do not support any legal claims”.

26,"August 18, 2022",Facebook’s WilmerHale Seeks Over $2M In Fees In Data Suit,"


Lawyers for Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc have asked a California federal judge to award more than $2.73 million in legal fees for their work on a lawsuit accusing an Israeli company of unlawfully scraping user and advertising information from the popular social media site.
Meta’s legal team at US law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr argued in a San Francisco court filingWednesday that the fees they seek under a California state computer data and fraud law are justified.
Meta sued advertising analytics company BrandTotal Ltd in 2020 and won a court ruling in May that Meta said in court filings had “shut down [BrandTotal’s] entire scraping operation.”
Wilmer attorneys including partner Sonal Mehta, a lead tech and intellectual property lawyer at the firm, said Meta negotiated fixed fees for parts of the legal work and that the overall amount sought “reflects a discount from WilmerHale’s standard billing rates.”
A representative from Meta on Thursday declined to comment, and a spokesperson for BrandTotal did not immediately return a message seeking comment.
A lawyer for BrandTotal, Rudy Telscher of Husch Blackwell in St. Louis, told Reuters his client will oppose Meta’s fee bid.
Telscher said “we do not believe the conduct was of a nature warranting fees and certainly not at the level that Facebook seeks.”
BrandTotal will ask the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals to take up the underlying legal issues, he said. The case raises issues over whether “social media companies, like Facebook, can contractually prevent users from selling data they own under the California Consumer Protection Act to companies like BrandTotal,” Telscher said.

28,"August 1, 2022",Facebook To End Payments To US News Publishers,"


Major news organizations like The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Washington Post are among the media outlets that will be affected by Meta’s recent decision to phase out exclusive deals with news publishers.
The planned axing of paid deals with American publishers — worth more than $100 million — is part of Mata’s goal to restructure and shift focus from its news tab strategy to the creator economy.
“A lot has changed since we signed deals three years ago to test bringing additional news links to Facebook News in the US,” a Facebook spokeswoman told the Wall Street Journal. “Most people do not come to Facebook for news, and as a business, it doesn’t make sense to overinvest in areas that don’t align with user preferences.”
It is worth noting that deals the firm has in other regions, particularly Europe, will not be affected by the changes. Facebook News will continue to maintain partnerships with outlets in the UK, France and Germany.
In fact, under regulatory pressure to remunerate content creators for news distributed on Big Tech platforms, paid Facebook News deals in Europe seem to be solidly in place for the time being.
Google, another Big Tech firm, has also come under intense scrutiny from competition watchdogs in Europe, and last year, the US tech giant was forced to sign a deal to settle a copyright dispute with French news publishers.

29,"July 31, 2022","Meta May Be Forced To Remove Facebook, Instagram From EU","


Meta Platforms reiterated its warning that it may have to pull its popular Facebook and Instagram services from the European Union if a new transatlantic data transfer pact doesn’t materialize.
Meta could face a ban on its practice of exporting user data to the U.S. for which it is currently under scrutiny by Ireland’s data protection watchdog. The issue surrounds EU-U.S. data transfers that take place under standard contractual clauses (SCCs).
The EU and U.S. in March broke a deadlock to reach a tentative deal on a new data-transfer pact after a previous accord was struck down by the bloc’s top court over concerns U.S. agencies could snoop on the information without adequate privacy safeguards.
Negotiations on a new pact won’t likely conclude before next year, by which time the Irish watchdog may have already issued its ban.
“If a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from the EU to the US, we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe,” Meta said in a U.S. regulatory filing.
This “would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations,” it added.
The unanswered questions over data transfers stem from a 2020 ruling by the EU’s highest court that ended the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield agreement over long standing fears that it exposed EU citizens to illegal surveillance by U.S. intelligence agencies.
Up until now, SCCs have acted as a workaround to the EU’s toppling of the Privacy Shield but it appears that era is coming to an end.

A Federal Appeals Court is now weighing in on a lawsuit between Apple and the maker of Fortnite. Epic Games claims that Apple’s app store fees violate antitrust laws because Apple requires a cut of purchases made by other companies that use its app store.
Epic Games  aimed to get the court to allow for third-party app stores and alternate methods of getting apps on iOS devices, but ‌Epic Games‌ largely lost the lawsuit, leading it to file an appeal. Apple won the antitrust suit, but was ordered to allow developers to add in-app links to outside websites where payments could be accepted.

Apple does not want to change its ‌App Store‌ rules and also appealed, leading to the court battle today. Epic Games will argue that the court made “multiple legal errors” in its initial ruling, once again arguing for sideloading to be allowed.
Apple maintains that ‌Epic Games‌ lost the trial because of “unprecedented” and “unfounded” accusations of anticompetitive conduct that ultimately did not sway the judge. Epic, says Apple, made far-reaching claims at the edges of antitrust law, and there is no basis for the ruling to be overturned on appeal.

Apple and Amazon were accused in an antitrust lawsuit on Wednesday of conspiring to drive up the prices of iPhones and iPads. The lawsuit claims that Amazon and Apple colluded to eliminate third-party sellers on Amazon who offered these products at a lower price. 
The lawsuit was filed by law firm Hagens Berman in Washington. It alleged that the companies had an ‘unlawful horizontal agreement’ to reduce the ‘competitive threat posed by third-party merchants’, thus violating the US antitrust laws that prohibit such coordination, especially when it leads to higher prices or other harms to consumers, such as loss of quality or access.

Apple, in return, gave Amazon up to a 10 percent discount on its products. Based on a MacRumors report, there were about 600 third-party sellers of Apple devices on Amazon, but only seven were left following the 2019 agreement.  
The change transformed Amazon into the dominant reseller of new iPhones and iPads. According to a Reuters report on the lawsuit by plaintiff Steven Floyd of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, prices rose more than 10 per cent, while Apple stabilised the prices it charged in retail stores.

An appeals court in France today lowered a fine levied against Apple by the French Competition Authority due to alleged “anti-competitive behavior towards its distribution and retail network,” according to Reuters. 
The antitrust regulator fined Apple in 2020 after finding that it imposed prices on Apple Authorized Resellers in France so that prices were in line with those charged at Apple Stores and on Apple.com. The fine was reduced after the appeals court dropped one of the three main charges related to price-fixing allegations, and significantly lowered the rate applied to calculate the overall fine, according to the report.
At the time, it was the biggest fine levied by the antitrust regulator, which said Apple imposed prices on retail premium resellers so that the prices were aligned with those charged by the California firm in its own shops, or on the internet.
The appeals court backed the antitrust watchdog’s charge that Apple abused the retailers’ economic dependency on the company but tossed the fixed-pricing charge, one of the two sources said.
The investigation began after a dispute between Apple and one of its leading French wholesalers, which alleged that it went out of business due to Apple’s uncompetitive rules. When fined in 2020, Apple said the French Competition Authority’s decision was “disheartening” and “discards thirty years of legal precedent.”

By Damien Geradin (TILEC) & Stijn Huijts (Geradin Partners)
Cloud gaming represents a new model of video game distribution. It involves playing games that are streamed from a remote server (the cloud), and has the potential to revolutionize gaming as it is, at least in theory, device-agnostic, allowing AAA games to be played on any device with a connection to the internet. However, Apple blocks the emergence of cloud gaming apps on its Apple App Store, and Google, although not completely blocking them, still imposes restrictions on them. Apple’s prevention of cloud gaming apps has led the UK Competition and Markets Authority to make a Market Investigation Reference, which could lead to the authority imposing remedies on Apple.
This paper provides an introduction to cloud gaming and explains why it is an important development that offers huge potential for competition and innovation in digital markets. It then discusses Apple’s prevention of cloud gaming apps and examines Apple’s stated rationale for this policy, after which it also touches on Google’s restrictions. This is followed by a section that sets out other reasons why it may be in Apple’s commercial interest to block the emergence of cloud gaming apps, looking in particular at whether this may be linked to a desire to protect its position in the distribution of apps on iOS devices and its revenues from the sale of hardware. After this, the paper discusses how these restrictions have led to the UK Market Investigation Reference, and how they may be treated under the forthcoming EU Digital Markets Act.

An administrative court in Italy today scrapped a €173.3 million ($170.4 million) fine leveled at Apple and Amazon last year for alleged anti-competitive cooperation when selling Apple and Beats products, Reuters reports.
In November 2021, Italy’s antitrust watchdog hit Apple and Amazon with a $196 million fine in the culmination of an investigation that began in 2020 over allegations that the two companies had been blocking the sale of Apple and Beats devices to resellers in order to stifle competition and keep prices high.
The regulator said contractual provisions of a 2018 agreement between the two companies meant only selected resellers were allowed to sell the products on Amazon’s Italian store, which was in violation of EU rules and affected competition on prices.
Amazon was fined €68.7 million euros ($67.6 million), while Apple received a fine of $132.3 million. The watchdog also ordered the companies to end the restrictions to give retailers of genuine Apple and Beats products access to the Italian Amazon web store in a “non-discriminatory manner.”
Both Apple and Amazon appealed against the fines. “To ensure our customers purchase genuine products, we work closely with our reseller partners and have dedicated teams of experts around the world who work with law enforcement, customs and merchants to ensure only genuine Apple products are being sold,” Apple said, denying any wrongdoing. In a separate statement Amazon said it strongly disagreed with the decision of the Italian authority and that the proposed fine was “disproportionate and unjustified.”
Earlier this year, the fine was reduced to an overall €173.3 million ($170.4 million) due to a “material error” in the initial calculation. Amazon welcomed today’s ruling in a statement, while Apple and Italy’s antitrust regulator declined to comment.

A Swedish state-run pension fund sued Activision Blizzard Inc. and Microsoft Corp., claiming their planned $69 billion merger was rigged to exploit the beleaguered gaming giant’s sexual harassment crisis and protect its CEO.
The 205-page complaint also targets embattled Activision chief Bobby Kotick, plus current and ex-members of its board. It accuses them of engineering an underpriced deal in exchange for terms allowing Kotick to stay at the helm, at least until the transaction closes after a drawn-out regulatory review.
Knowing Activision and Kotick were “weak and wounded,” Microsoft used the leverage created by the scandal to acquire Activision “at a bargain price,” at an inopportune time, and following a sham process, according to the proposed class action. It was made public Nov. 10 in Delaware’s Chancery Court.

“Microsoft knowingly exploited the harassment scandal and its commercial leverage over Activision precisely to offer Kotick a way to save his own skin,” the lawsuit says. “It conspired with Kotick and the board to help them evade the personal and professional consequences of that scandal.”
Joe Christinat, a spokesman for Activision, defended the transaction Monday.
“This is a great deal for shareholders,” Christinat told Bloomberg Law. “We garnered 98% approval of votes cast. The board went through a thorough process to decide the right move for employees, shareholders, and players.”

Speaking at an event in London hosted by policy consulting group Global Counsel on Tuesday, Ofcom Chief Executive Melanie Dawes said self-regulation of the metaverse, a hypothetical digital world touted by Meta and others, wouldn’t fly under UK online safety laws.
“I’m not sure I really see that ‘self-regulatory phase,’ to be honest, existing from a UK perspective,” Dawes said. “If you’ve got young people in an environment where there’s user-generated content according to the scope of the bill then that will already be caught by the Online Safety Bill.”

The Online Safety Bill is a set of legislation that seeks to curb harmful content from being widely shared on the internet. The rules would impose a duty of care on firms requiring them to have robust and proportionate measures to deal with harmful materials such as vaccine disinformation or posts promoting self-harm.
Violations of the law — once it is approved — could lead to fines of up to 10% of annual global revenues. Down the track, senior tech executives may also face criminal liability for more extreme breaches.
The bill is especially concerned with the protection of children, having been developed in response to the death of Molly Russell, a U.K. teen who took her own life after being exposed to suicide-related posts on Instagram. In September, a coroner investigating Russell’s death made the landmark conclusion that “negative effects” of social media contributed to her death.

This week Microsoft has accused UK’s competition watchdog of relying on “self-serving” input from rival Sony inits decision to probe the tech giant’s $69 Billion takeover of Activision Blizzard, reported Reuters. 
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said last month that the acquisition could harm competition and needed to be investigated in depth.
Microsoft could use its control over popular games to harm rivals, including those operating in multi-game subscription services and cloud gaming, it said.
“The CMA is concerned that having full control over this powerful catalogue (…) could result in Microsoft harming consumers by impairing Sony’s — Microsoft’s closest gaming rival— ability to compete,” it said.
Microsoft said the CMA had adopted Sony’s complaints without the “appropriate level of critical review”.
In its submission, it said Sony’s PlayStation had been the largest console platform for more than 20 years, and it was not credible to suggest its dominance would be challenged by losing access to one title.
“The Referral Decision incorrectly relies on self-serving statements by Sony which significantly exaggerate the importance of ‘Call of Duty’ to it and neglect to account for Sony’s clear ability to competitively respond,” Microsoft said.

The Activision Blizzard acquisition by Microsoft is one that has caught many eyes on both the gaming industry and community. 
The deal, if approved, would see Microsoft owning the Call of Duty IP as well as other IPs in the Activision Blizzard repertoire. The deal is currently going through heavy scrutiny by several organizations. One of which is the European Commission.
As of now, Microsoft will have to wait until November 8 to hear more about whether the European Commission will permit the deal to go into its next phase. The acquisition is scrutinized by global regulators amid antitrust concerns during a time of increasing consolidation in the gaming industry, after all, so every bit of scrutiny is justified.
Now, several antitrust regulators from the EU are asking game developers whether Microsoft will be incentivized to block access to Call of Duty from rivals. According to the document that Reuters first spotted, these regulators also want to know if Activision’s trove of user data would give Microsoft a competitive advantage in developing, publishing, and distributing computer and console games.
The regulators also want to know if there would be sufficient alternative suppliers in the market following the deal and also in the event Microsoft decides to make Activision’s games exclusively available on its Xbox, Xbox Game Pass and its cloud game streaming services. Another one of the questions asked if rivals such as NVIDIA GeForce NOW, PlayStation, Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, and Facebook Gaming would be considered attractive following the deal’s closure.

Google has struck deals with at least 24 big app developers to stop them from competing with its Play Store, including an agreement to pay Activision Blizzard about $360 million over three years, according to a court filing on Thursday.
Google also agreed in 2020 to pay Tencent Riot Games unit, which makes “League of Legends,” $30 million over one year in a similar deal, the filing stated.

Google agreed to a record $391.5 million privacy settlement with a 40-state coalition of attorneys general on Monday for charges that it misled users into thinking they had turned off location tracking in their account settings even as the company continued collecting that information.
Under the settlement, Google will also make its location tracking disclosures clearer starting in 2023.

The attorneys general said that the agreement was the biggest internet privacy settlement by U.S. states. It capped a four-year investigation into the internet search giant for violating the states’ consumer protection laws.
States have taken an increasingly central role in reining in the power and business models of Silicon Valley corporations, amid a vacuum of action from federal lawmakers.
More than four years after Europe rolled out data privacy rules for its citizens, Congress and regulators have failed to agree to a federal data protection law in the United States. Lawmakers have squabbled over details of privacy proposals, and tech giants have deployed armies of lobbyists to water down or destroy legislation.

Google parent Alphabet denied claims in an antitrust case in California federal court that the company had deleted employees’ electronic “chats” to deprive plaintiffs of evidence in their case alleging anticompetitive conduct within the Google Play Store.
Lawyers for Google at law firms Morgan, Lewis & Bockius and at Munger, Tolles & Olson in a court filing said the company had taken appropriate steps “to preserve and produce” evidence of employees’ internal chats. The company called the plaintiffs’ bid for sanctions “meritless” and asked US District Judge James Donato in San Francisco to reject the bid.

MRC Free Speech America has conducted a series of studies related to Google’s treatment of Republicans ahead of the critical midterm elections. Despite Google’s vehement denials of any wrongdoing, the conservative media watchdog believes Google “does change its algorithm to benefit certain political candidates,” and is focused on the Senate because its “search bias” didn’t carry over to House races where the GOP is already favored.

The latest study focused on 10 key races in the House and Senate involving sitting lawmakers who have spoken out against Big Tech. MRC said its findings indicated Google “severely buried or did not even display several Republicans’ campaign websites” if they have acted aggressively toward Big Tech.
“In fact, the search giant completely hid six of 10 Republicans’ campaign websites from the first page of results,” MRC associate editor Brian Bradley wrote.
“Google did not show Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul’s campaign website on its front page of search results but showed his Democrat challenger Charles Booker’s campaign website as the first result. Paul, who is up for re-election, has been a frequent critic of Big Tech,” Bradley added. “Google buried [Colorado] Rep. Ken Buck’s campaign website as the 15th result out of 20 on the first page, while elevating his challenger Democrat Ike McCorkle’s campaign website to the No. 3 spot in the search results. Buck has introduced legislation that would strengthen antitrust actions brought against industries including Big Tech.”

Tech industry players are concerned that the Supreme Court could impose new rules that upset the internet economy.
That’s according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, which looks at the court’s upcoming ruling on Section 230, a federal law that guards sites such as Facebook or YouTube against lawsuits over harmful content posted by third parties.
The case originated with a lawsuit against YouTube owner Google by the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, who was killed in the 2015 Islamic State terrorist attack in Paris. They argue that YouTube aided ISIS by recommending the group’s videos to users. Google says that Section 230 guards it against liability for content added to its site by users.

The tech industry has already begun to try to figure out its response to an unfavorable ruling, including petitioning Congress to pass legislation to rewrite Section 230 with more obvious liability protections, said Matt Schruers, president of the trade group Computer and Communications Industry Association.
“I could foresee an outcome where the litigation and compliance risks stemming from an ill-considered decision are so great that many small firms exit the market,” which would lead to foreign-based services picking up market share, he said. “To say that another way, US competitiveness is potentially at risk here, and we have the most to lose from getting this wrong,” Schruers said.

The rulings come as Google faces increased antitrust scrutiny across the world. Last month, it suffered a major setback when a European court upheld a 2018 ruling saying it was largely confirming a decision that the company imposed “unlawful restrictions on manufacturers of Android mobile devices.” Google plans to appeal the decision, where it faces a record $4.1 billion fine.
The Competition Commission of India’s (CCI) Android ruling, despite involving a smaller $162 million fine, has worried Google since it seeks wider ranging remedial measures, three sources aware of company’s thinking said.
One of the sources said that Google was concerned that the CCI’s decision could increase regulatory pressures in other jurisdictions and a legal appeal to block implementation of the antitrust directive was being planned within weeks.
Google declined to comment on its legal plans, reiterating its statement from last week that the CCI order was “a major setback for Indian consumers and businesses, opening serious security risks … and raising the cost of mobile devices for Indians.”
Abhishek Manu Singhvi, lead counsel for Google in its arguments before the CCI, tweeted on Wednesday that “inherent & patent infirmities” in the order make a challenge inevitable and likely to succeed.

58,"October 26, 2022",Google To Pay YouTube Creators In Bid Compete With TikTok,"


Calling it “a big deal” for creators, Google parent Alphabet said Tuesday it will pay top creative talent to post videos on its new YouTube Shorts platform as it aims to grab a bigger slice of a shrinking ad-spend pie while slowing the advance of rival TikTok.
By introducing the new revenue sharing plan, which it says will kick in early next year, Google becomes the fourth major player this month to announce a big move to boost the creator economy at a time when the real economy is, by most accounts, headed into recession.
“This update makes YouTube the only platform where creators can monetize their content across short, long and live formats at scale,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told investors on the company’s third quarter earnings webcast Tuesday (Oct 25) evening.
Related: Google & Youtube Hit With Patent Fine Over Video Sharing
The monetization move not only comes in the wake of related initiatives launched recently by Walmart, Meta and Instagram’s Reels, as well as a new payment program from Visa, but also reflects the changing media consumption habits that increasingly tight-fisted advertisers are looking to capture.
Given that 80% of Alphabet’s revenues come from advertising, and three-fourths of that come from Google Search alone, it’s fair to say that the company’s $54 billion exposure to online ad spend in Q3 — and in turn, the pulse of the global economy — is second to none.
As a result, news that the search giant saw its Q3 sales growth slow to 4% from a blistering 43% pace a year ago did not sit well with already-weary investors, who are growing tired of seeing sales and profits decline while costs and headcount continue to rise — all while the stock has lost more than 30% so far this year.
Officially, Alphabet said its employee base rose about 25%, ending the quarter at 187,000 from 150,000 in 2021.
“In the third quarter, we did see a pullback in spend by some advertisers in certain areas and search ads,” Alphabet Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler told investors Tuesday (Oct 25) evening, pointing to weak spending in financial services generally — and a pullback in insurance, loan, mortgage and crypto subcategories specifically — as indicative of the broader trend.
“There’s no question we’re operating in an uncertain environment and that businesses big and small continue to get tested in new and different ways,” Schindler added, noting that alongside Shorts, the company’s YouTube TV unit was adding subscribers and viewing hours at an unmatched — and almost unfathomable — clip.
On average, Schindler said, global viewers are watching more than 700 million hours of YouTube content on TV daily, with another 30 billion daily views on Shorts via a base of 1.5 billion monthly active users.
“TV is a big area for us,” Pichai said. “Nielsen reported that YouTube was the leader in streaming TV viewership in the US in September for the first time,” he added, speaking to what Schindler characterized as strong engagement driven by a “streaming boom.”

Apple and Amazon were accused in an antitrust lawsuit on Wednesday of conspiring to drive up the prices of iPhones and iPads. The lawsuit claims that Amazon and Apple colluded to eliminate third-party sellers on Amazon who offered these products at a lower price. 
The lawsuit was filed by law firm Hagens Berman in Washington. It alleged that the companies had an ‘unlawful horizontal agreement’ to reduce the ‘competitive threat posed by third-party merchants’, thus violating the US antitrust laws that prohibit such coordination, especially when it leads to higher prices or other harms to consumers, such as loss of quality or access.

The lawsuit claimed that Amazon expelled third-party sellers after it signed a deal with Apple in 2019. The number of Apple resellers on Amazon fell to around 20 per country, according to reports. Apple, in return, gave Amazon up to a 10 percent discount on its products. Based on a MacRumors report, there were about 600 third-party sellers of Apple devices on Amazon, but only seven were left following the 2019 agreement.  
The change transformed Amazon into the dominant reseller of new iPhones and iPads. According to a Reuters report on the lawsuit by plaintiff Steven Floyd of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, prices rose more than 10 per cent, while Apple stabilised the prices it charged in retail stores.

Amazon is facing a $1 billion class action lawsuit in the UK, where the company has been accused of using a “secretive” algorithm to abuse its dominant position in e-commerce.
Amazon harms its customers by directing them to its “featured offer,” resulting in better-value deals being hidden and consumers ending up paying more for products, according to the suit, which is expected to be filed with the Competition Appeal Tribunal in October.
The suit alleges Amazon exploits its so-called “Buy Box” to steer shoppers toward its own products and items from third-party sellers who use its order fulfillment and delivery services.
Related: Italian Court Overturns Apple & Amazon’s Antitrust Fine
The Buy Box is an area on Amazon’s product pages that gives customers a one-click option to “Buy Now” or “Add to Basket.” Amazon sets certain criteria for sellers to become Buy Box eligible and, if accepted, they gain placement advantages for their listings.
It adds that Amazon uses a “secretive and self-favouring algorithm to ensure that the Buy Box nearly always features goods sold directly by Amazon itself, or by third-party retailers who pay hefty storage and delivery fees to Amazon.”
The litigation is being led by Hausfeld, a specialist law firm. Between 80% to 92% of Amazon purchases are made on its Buy Box tool, according to Hausfeld.
Anyone who lives in the U.K. and made a purchase on Amazon since October 2016 falls under the claimant class, Hausfeld added.
Hausfeld estimates total damages from the litigation in the region of £900 million ($1 billion) if it succeeds. Julie Hunter, an independent consultant, is the lead representative.
“Millions of consumers have paid too much and been denied choice. This action seeks fair redress for them,” said Lesley Hannah, one of the Hausfeld partners leading the litigation. “Amazon takes advantage of consumers’ well-known tendency to focus on prominently-placed and eye-catching displays, such as the Buy Box.”
“Amazon doesn’t present consumers with a fair range of choices – on the contrary, the design of the Buy Box makes it difficult for consumers to locate and purchase better or cheaper options,” Hannah added. “Amazon should not be allowed to take advantage of its customers in this anticompetitive way.”

An administrative court in Italy today scrapped a €173.3 million ($170.4 million) fine leveled at Apple and Amazon last year for alleged anti-competitive cooperation when selling Apple and Beats products, Reuters reports.
In November 2021, Italy’s antitrust watchdog hit Apple and Amazon with a $196 million fine in the culmination of an investigation that began in 2020 over allegations that the two companies had been blocking the sale of Apple and Beats devices to resellers in order to stifle competition and keep prices high.
The regulator said contractual provisions of a 2018 agreement between the two companies meant only selected resellers were allowed to sell the products on Amazon’s Italian store, which was in violation of EU rules and affected competition on prices.
Amazon was fined €68.7 million euros ($67.6 million), while Apple received a fine of $132.3 million. The watchdog also ordered the companies to end the restrictions to give retailers of genuine Apple and Beats products access to the Italian Amazon web store in a “non-discriminatory manner.”
Both Apple and Amazon appealed against the fines. “To ensure our customers purchase genuine products, we work closely with our reseller partners and have dedicated teams of experts around the world who work with law enforcement, customs and merchants to ensure only genuine Apple products are being sold,” Apple said, denying any wrongdoing. In a separate statement Amazon said it strongly disagreed with the decision of the Italian authority and that the proposed fine was “disproportionate and unjustified.”
Earlier this year, the fine was reduced to an overall €173.3 million ($170.4 million) due to a “material error” in the initial calculation. Amazon welcomed today’s ruling in a statement, while Apple and Italy’s antitrust regulator declined to comment.

Britain’s media watchdog agency Ofcom announced the investigation and said it will look into whether the two companies and Microsoft may have an unfair competitive advantage in the cloud services industry.

Specifically in the crosshairs of the inquiry are Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, all of which dominate global cloud storage services — a powerful tool that allows businesses to store data on remote servers accessible from anywhere as opposed to localized hard drives.
Depending on the findings of the investigation, the agency could take further action to rein in the corporate behemoths.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and CEO Andy Jassy must testify in a Federal Trade Commission probe into whether the company misled people into subscribing to Amazon Prime and other services, the FTC said Wednesday.
Last month Amazon asked the FTC to cancel subpoenas issued to Messrs. Bezos and Jassy, arguing that they aren’t steeped in the details of Prime’s sign-up and cancellation processes, reported The Wall Street Journal.  The FTC’s staff began the probe in March 2021, examining whether the company deceived customers into signing up for Prime and didn’t provide a simple way to cancel the program’s recurring charges, according to the order issued Wednesday.
But agency commissioners said Amazon had not met the legal threshold to quash the civil subpoenas issued to the two men. 
“Amazon provides no reason why the Commission must accept anything less than all the relevant testimony it can obtain from these two witnesses,” FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson wrote in Wednesday’s order.
In a statement, Amazon said it is “disappointed but unsurprised the FTC largely declined to rule against itself, but we’re pleased that the agency walked backed its broadest requests and will allow witnesses to choose their own counsel.”
“Amazon has cooperated with the FTC throughout the investigation and already produced tens of thousands of pages of documents,” the company said. “We are committed to engaging constructively with FTC staff, but we remain concerned that the latest requests are overly broad and needlessly burdensome, and we will explore all our options.”
The requirement that Amazon’s most powerful leaders testify to the FTC underscores the depth and breadth of the agency’s investigation, which covers a sweeping range of Amazon services.

74,"September 13, 2022",Plaintiffs Question Scope Of Facebook’s $90M Privacy Settlement,"


A group of plaintiffs’ lawyers has raised questions about the scope of Meta’s pending $90 million privacy settlement in California federal court, telling a judge that their allegations in a separate antitrust case should be carved out and not swept up into the deal.
The attorneys at Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro and Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan said in a court filing on Monday they were concerned that broad language in the privacy settlement could be used to thwart pending antitrust claims in front of another judge in California’s Northern US District Court.
The privacy settlement would resolve claims that Facebook tracked users’ web activity even after they had logged out of the social media website. In the antitrust case, Facebook is accused of exploiting user data to curb competition. The case also involves the company’s data collection practices.
The data privacy settlement announced in February “risks providing a benefit to common defendant Meta Platforms Inc for which it did not bargain and to which it is not entitled,” lawyers for the antitrust plaintiffs said in Monday’s court filing.
The plaintiffs’ attorneys asked US District Judge Edward Davila to include a sentence in the privacy settlement that says the resolution of the dispute does not limit the claims alleged in the antitrust litigation.

75,"August 28, 2022",Meta Agrees To Settle Facebook Privacy Suit,"


Meta Platforms’s Facebook has in-principle agreed to settle a lawsuit in the San Francisco federal court seeking damages for letting third parties including Cambridge Analytica access the private data of users, a court filing showed.
The financial terms were not disclosed in the filing on Friday that asked the judge to put the class action on hold for 60 days until the lawyers for both plaintiffs and Facebook finalize a written settlement.
The four-year-old lawsuit alleged that Facebook violated consumer privacy laws by sharing personal data of users with third parties such as the now-defunct British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.
Facebook has said its privacy practices are consistent with its disclosures and “do not support any legal claims”.

76,"August 18, 2022",Facebook’s WilmerHale Seeks Over $2M In Fees In Data Suit,"


Lawyers for Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc have asked a California federal judge to award more than $2.73 million in legal fees for their work on a lawsuit accusing an Israeli company of unlawfully scraping user and advertising information from the popular social media site.
Meta’s legal team at US law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr argued in a San Francisco court filingWednesday that the fees they seek under a California state computer data and fraud law are justified.
Meta sued advertising analytics company BrandTotal Ltd in 2020 and won a court ruling in May that Meta said in court filings had “shut down [BrandTotal’s] entire scraping operation.”
Wilmer attorneys including partner Sonal Mehta, a lead tech and intellectual property lawyer at the firm, said Meta negotiated fixed fees for parts of the legal work and that the overall amount sought “reflects a discount from WilmerHale’s standard billing rates.”
A representative from Meta on Thursday declined to comment, and a spokesperson for BrandTotal did not immediately return a message seeking comment.
A lawyer for BrandTotal, Rudy Telscher of Husch Blackwell in St. Louis, told Reuters his client will oppose Meta’s fee bid.
Telscher said “we do not believe the conduct was of a nature warranting fees and certainly not at the level that Facebook seeks.”
BrandTotal will ask the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals to take up the underlying legal issues, he said. The case raises issues over whether “social media companies, like Facebook, can contractually prevent users from selling data they own under the California Consumer Protection Act to companies like BrandTotal,” Telscher said.

78,"August 1, 2022",Facebook To End Payments To US News Publishers,"


Major news organizations like The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Washington Post are among the media outlets that will be affected by Meta’s recent decision to phase out exclusive deals with news publishers.
The planned axing of paid deals with American publishers — worth more than $100 million — is part of Mata’s goal to restructure and shift focus from its news tab strategy to the creator economy.
“A lot has changed since we signed deals three years ago to test bringing additional news links to Facebook News in the US,” a Facebook spokeswoman told the Wall Street Journal. “Most people do not come to Facebook for news, and as a business, it doesn’t make sense to overinvest in areas that don’t align with user preferences.”
It is worth noting that deals the firm has in other regions, particularly Europe, will not be affected by the changes. Facebook News will continue to maintain partnerships with outlets in the UK, France and Germany.
In fact, under regulatory pressure to remunerate content creators for news distributed on Big Tech platforms, paid Facebook News deals in Europe seem to be solidly in place for the time being.
Google, another Big Tech firm, has also come under intense scrutiny from competition watchdogs in Europe, and last year, the US tech giant was forced to sign a deal to settle a copyright dispute with French news publishers.

79,"July 31, 2022","Meta May Be Forced To Remove Facebook, Instagram From EU","


Meta Platforms reiterated its warning that it may have to pull its popular Facebook and Instagram services from the European Union if a new transatlantic data transfer pact doesn’t materialize.
Meta could face a ban on its practice of exporting user data to the U.S. for which it is currently under scrutiny by Ireland’s data protection watchdog. The issue surrounds EU-U.S. data transfers that take place under standard contractual clauses (SCCs).
The EU and U.S. in March broke a deadlock to reach a tentative deal on a new data-transfer pact after a previous accord was struck down by the bloc’s top court over concerns U.S. agencies could snoop on the information without adequate privacy safeguards.
Negotiations on a new pact won’t likely conclude before next year, by which time the Irish watchdog may have already issued its ban.
“If a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from the EU to the US, we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe,” Meta said in a U.S. regulatory filing.
This “would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations,” it added.
The unanswered questions over data transfers stem from a 2020 ruling by the EU’s highest court that ended the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield agreement over long standing fears that it exposed EU citizens to illegal surveillance by U.S. intelligence agencies.
Up until now, SCCs have acted as a workaround to the EU’s toppling of the Privacy Shield but it appears that era is coming to an end.

A Federal Appeals Court is now weighing in on a lawsuit between Apple and the maker of Fortnite. Epic Games claims that Apple’s app store fees violate antitrust laws because Apple requires a cut of purchases made by other companies that use its app store.
Epic Games  aimed to get the court to allow for third-party app stores and alternate methods of getting apps on iOS devices, but ‌Epic Games‌ largely lost the lawsuit, leading it to file an appeal. Apple won the antitrust suit, but was ordered to allow developers to add in-app links to outside websites where payments could be accepted.

Apple does not want to change its ‌App Store‌ rules and also appealed, leading to the court battle today. Epic Games will argue that the court made “multiple legal errors” in its initial ruling, once again arguing for sideloading to be allowed.
Apple maintains that ‌Epic Games‌ lost the trial because of “unprecedented” and “unfounded” accusations of anticompetitive conduct that ultimately did not sway the judge. Epic, says Apple, made far-reaching claims at the edges of antitrust law, and there is no basis for the ruling to be overturned on appeal. Apple will also argue that the original court made an error when implementing an injunction that will force ‌App Store‌ changes.

The “Fortnite” creator sued Apple in 2020 alleging that the iPhone maker’s App Store rules, under which software developers must pay commissions of up to 30% on in-app purchases, violated US antitrust law.
After a three-week trial last year, a judge largely sided with Apple, stopping short of dubbing the company an “illegal monopolist” and upholding its right to charge the commissions.

Apple and Amazon were accused in an antitrust lawsuit on Wednesday of conspiring to drive up the prices of iPhones and iPads. The lawsuit claims that Amazon and Apple colluded to eliminate third-party sellers on Amazon who offered these products at a lower price. 
The lawsuit was filed by law firm Hagens Berman in Washington. It alleged that the companies had an ‘unlawful horizontal agreement’ to reduce the ‘competitive threat posed by third-party merchants’, thus violating the US antitrust laws that prohibit such coordination, especially when it leads to higher prices or other harms to consumers, such as loss of quality or access.

The lawsuit claimed that Amazon expelled third-party sellers after it signed a deal with Apple in 2019. The number of Apple resellers on Amazon fell to around 20 per country, according to reports. Apple, in return, gave Amazon up to a 10 percent discount on its products. Based on a MacRumors report, there were about 600 third-party sellers of Apple devices on Amazon, but only seven were left following the 2019 agreement.  
The change transformed Amazon into the dominant reseller of new iPhones and iPads. According to a Reuters report on the lawsuit by plaintiff Steven Floyd of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, prices rose more than 10 per cent, while Apple stabilised the prices it charged in retail stores.

85,"October 6, 2022",French Court Cuts Down Antitrust Fine Against Apple,"
An appeals court in France today lowered a fine levied against Apple by the French Competition Authority due to alleged “anti-competitive behavior towards its distribution and retail network,” according to Reuters. 
The antitrust regulator fined Apple in 2020 after finding that it imposed prices on Apple Authorized Resellers in France so that prices were in line with those charged at Apple Stores and on Apple.com. The fine was reduced after the appeals court dropped one of the three main charges related to price-fixing allegations, and significantly lowered the rate applied to calculate the overall fine, according to the report.
At the time, it was the biggest fine levied by the antitrust regulator, which said Apple imposed prices on retail premium resellers so that the prices were aligned with those charged by the California firm in its own shops, or on the internet.
The appeals court backed the antitrust watchdog’s charge that Apple abused the retailers’ economic dependency on the company but tossed the fixed-pricing charge, one of the two sources said.
The investigation began after a dispute between Apple and one of its leading French wholesalers, which alleged that it went out of business due to Apple’s uncompetitive rules. When fined in 2020, Apple said the French Competition Authority’s decision was “disheartening” and “discards thirty years of legal precedent.”

By Damien Geradin (TILEC) & Stijn Huijts (Geradin Partners)
Cloud gaming represents a new model of video game distribution. It involves playing games that are streamed from a remote server (the cloud), and has the potential to revolutionize gaming as it is, at least in theory, device-agnostic, allowing AAA games to be played on any device with a connection to the internet. However, Apple blocks the emergence of cloud gaming apps on its Apple App Store, and Google, although not completely blocking them, still imposes restrictions on them. Apple’s prevention of cloud gaming apps has led the UK Competition and Markets Authority to make a Market Investigation Reference, which could lead to the authority imposing remedies on Apple.
This paper provides an introduction to cloud gaming and explains why it is an important development that offers huge potential for competition and innovation in digital markets. It then discusses Apple’s prevention of cloud gaming apps and examines Apple’s stated rationale for this policy, after which it also touches on Google’s restrictions. This is followed by a section that sets out other reasons why it may be in Apple’s commercial interest to block the emergence of cloud gaming apps, looking in particular at whether this may be linked to a desire to protect its position in the distribution of apps on iOS devices and its revenues from the sale of hardware. After this, the paper discusses how these restrictions have led to the UK Market Investigation Reference, and how they may be treated under the forthcoming EU Digital Markets Act.

An administrative court in Italy today scrapped a €173.3 million ($170.4 million) fine leveled at Apple and Amazon last year for alleged anti-competitive cooperation when selling Apple and Beats products, Reuters reports.
In November 2021, Italy’s antitrust watchdog hit Apple and Amazon with a $196 million fine in the culmination of an investigation that began in 2020 over allegations that the two companies had been blocking the sale of Apple and Beats devices to resellers in order to stifle competition and keep prices high.
The regulator said contractual provisions of a 2018 agreement between the two companies meant only selected resellers were allowed to sell the products on Amazon’s Italian store, which was in violation of EU rules and affected competition on prices.
Amazon was fined €68.7 million euros ($67.6 million), while Apple received a fine of $132.3 million. The watchdog also ordered the companies to end the restrictions to give retailers of genuine Apple and Beats products access to the Italian Amazon web store in a “non-discriminatory manner.”
Both Apple and Amazon appealed against the fines. “To ensure our customers purchase genuine products, we work closely with our reseller partners and have dedicated teams of experts around the world who work with law enforcement, customs and merchants to ensure only genuine Apple products are being sold,” Apple said, denying any wrongdoing. In a separate statement Amazon said it strongly disagreed with the decision of the Italian authority and that the proposed fine was “disproportionate and unjustified.”
Earlier this year, the fine was reduced to an overall €173.3 million ($170.4 million) due to a “material error” in the initial calculation. Amazon welcomed today’s ruling in a statement, while Apple and Italy’s antitrust regulator declined to comment.

A Swedish state-run pension fund sued Activision Blizzard Inc. and Microsoft Corp., claiming their planned $69 billion merger was rigged to exploit the beleaguered gaming giant’s sexual harassment crisis and protect its CEO.
The 205-page complaint also targets embattled Activision chief Bobby Kotick, plus current and ex-members of its board. It accuses them of engineering an underpriced deal in exchange for terms allowing Kotick to stay at the helm, at least until the transaction closes after a drawn-out regulatory review.
Knowing Activision and Kotick were “weak and wounded,” Microsoft used the leverage created by the scandal to acquire Activision “at a bargain price,” at an inopportune time, and following a sham process, according to the proposed class action. It was made public Nov. 10 in Delaware’s Chancery Court.

“Microsoft knowingly exploited the harassment scandal and its commercial leverage over Activision precisely to offer Kotick a way to save his own skin,” the lawsuit says. “It conspired with Kotick and the board to help them evade the personal and professional consequences of that scandal.”
Joe Christinat, a spokesman for Activision, defended the transaction Monday.
“This is a great deal for shareholders,” Christinat told Bloomberg Law. “We garnered 98% approval of votes cast. The board went through a thorough process to decide the right move for employees, shareholders, and players.”

Speaking at an event in London hosted by policy consulting group Global Counsel on Tuesday, Ofcom Chief Executive Melanie Dawes said self-regulation of the metaverse, a hypothetical digital world touted by Meta and others, wouldn’t fly under UK online safety laws.
“I’m not sure I really see that ‘self-regulatory phase,’ to be honest, existing from a UK perspective,” Dawes said. “If you’ve got young people in an environment where there’s user-generated content according to the scope of the bill then that will already be caught by the Online Safety Bill.”

The Online Safety Bill is a set of legislation that seeks to curb harmful content from being widely shared on the internet. The rules would impose a duty of care on firms requiring them to have robust and proportionate measures to deal with harmful materials such as vaccine disinformation or posts promoting self-harm.
Violations of the law — once it is approved — could lead to fines of up to 10% of annual global revenues. Down the track, senior tech executives may also face criminal liability for more extreme breaches.
The bill is especially concerned with the protection of children, having been developed in response to the death of Molly Russell, a U.K. teen who took her own life after being exposed to suicide-related posts on Instagram. In September, a coroner investigating Russell’s death made the landmark conclusion that “negative effects” of social media contributed to her death.

This week Microsoft has accused UK’s competition watchdog of relying on “self-serving” input from rival Sony inits decision to probe the tech giant’s $69 Billion takeover of Activision Blizzard, reported Reuters. 
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said last month that the acquisition could harm competition and needed to be investigated in depth.
Microsoft could use its control over popular games to harm rivals, including those operating in multi-game subscription services and cloud gaming, it said.
“The CMA is concerned that having full control over this powerful catalogue (…) could result in Microsoft harming consumers by impairing Sony’s — Microsoft’s closest gaming rival— ability to compete,” it said.
Microsoft said the CMA had adopted Sony’s complaints without the “appropriate level of critical review”.
In its submission, it said Sony’s PlayStation had been the largest console platform for more than 20 years, and it was not credible to suggest its dominance would be challenged by losing access to one title.
“The Referral Decision incorrectly relies on self-serving statements by Sony which significantly exaggerate the importance of ‘Call of Duty’ to it and neglect to account for Sony’s clear ability to competitively respond,” Microsoft said.

The Activision Blizzard acquisition by Microsoft is one that has caught many eyes on both the gaming industry and community. 
The deal, if approved, would see Microsoft owning the Call of Duty IP as well as other IPs in the Activision Blizzard repertoire. The deal is currently going through heavy scrutiny by several organizations. One of which is the European Commission.
As of now, Microsoft will have to wait until November 8 to hear more about whether the European Commission will permit the deal to go into its next phase. The acquisition is scrutinized by global regulators amid antitrust concerns during a time of increasing consolidation in the gaming industry, after all, so every bit of scrutiny is justified.
Now, several antitrust regulators from the EU are asking game developers whether Microsoft will be incentivized to block access to Call of Duty from rivals. According to the document that Reuters first spotted, these regulators also want to know if Activision’s trove of user data would give Microsoft a competitive advantage in developing, publishing, and distributing computer and console games.
The regulators also want to know if there would be sufficient alternative suppliers in the market following the deal and also in the event Microsoft decides to make Activision’s games exclusively available on its Xbox, Xbox Game Pass and its cloud game streaming services. Another one of the questions asked if rivals such as NVIDIA GeForce NOW, PlayStation, Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, and Facebook Gaming would be considered attractive following the deal’s closure.

Moreover, Fitbit informed consumers that they weren’t eligible for a second device if they had availed a replacement device earlier and the original two-year ‘limited warranty period’ of the device had expired.
“All consumers have automatic consumer guarantee rights that cannot be excluded, restricted or modified. The consumer guarantee rights exist in addition to any warranties offered by manufacturers,” said Gina Cass-Gottlieb, chairman of ACCC.
“Products must be of acceptable quality, and retailers must provide a remedy for faulty goods which include a repair, replacement or refund, depending on the circumstances,” she added.

Google and Israel’s Reichman University have set up a school to train high-tech professionals, offering courses in computer programming, sales and data analysis among other subjects, the university said on Monday.
Israel has a vibrant high-tech sector but a severe shortage of skilled tech workers has led to tens of thousands of unfilled positions.
The School of High Tech will subsidise students from under-represented communities “including women, the ultra-Orthodox, Arabs, members of the Ethiopian community and people from the geo-social periphery and disadvantaged socio-economic groups,” the university said.
“We believe that a variety of voices, opinions and perspectives enriches Israeli high-tech and its developments,” said Barak Regev, managing director of Google Israel.
Courses are being rolled out over the next few weeks and students completing courses at the school will earn credit towards a degree, the university said.
Courses, which will be held at the Google Campus in Tel Aviv and the Reichman University in the Israeli city of Herzliya, will be offered in programming, software testing, business development, sales and data analysis and Google will provide scholarships to participants.
The technology sector accounts for about 15% of Israel’s economic activity and hundreds of new startups are founded each year. In the first half of 2022, Israeli tech firms raised nearly $10 billion in investments, according to the Israeli Tech Review.

Google said on Friday that the Indian antitrust watchdog’s decision to fine it 13.38 billion Indian rupees ($161.95 million) for anti-competitive practices was a “major setback” for consumers and businesses in the country.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Thursday said Google leveraged its dominant position in markets such as online search and app store for Android to protect the position of its apps like Chrome and YouTube in mobile Web browsers and online video hosting.

Besides the fine, the CCI also ordered Google to change its approach to its Android platform and restricted it from certain revenue sharing agreements with smartphone makers.
“Android has created more choice for everyone, and supports thousands of successful businesses in India and around the world,” a Google spokesperson said on Friday.
“The CCI’s decision is a major setback for Indian consumers and businesses, opening serious security risks for Indians who trust Android’s security features, and raising the cost of mobile devices for Indians.”

Texas has filed a lawsuit against Google for allegedly collecting biometric data of millions of Texans without obtaining proper consent, the attorney general’s office said in a statement on Thursday.
The complaint says that companies operating in Texas have been barred for more than a decade from collecting people’s faces, voices or other biometric data without advanced, informed consent.
“In blatant defiance of that law, Google has, since at least 2015, collected biometric data from innumerable Texans and used their faces and their voices to serve Google’s commercial ends,” the complaint said. “Indeed, all across the state, everyday Texans have become unwitting cash cows being milked by Google for profits.”

Google said it would fight the lawsuit, saying that users of the services had the option to turn off the biometric collection feature.
“AG Paxton is once again mischaracterizing our products in another breathless lawsuit,” said Google spokesman Jose Castaneda. “We will set the record straight in court.”
The lawsuit is one of several filed by states against Google alleging unfair practices with regard to privacy. Arizona settled one in early October for $85 million. Texas, Indiana, Washington State and the District of Columbia sued Google in January over what they called deceptive location-tracking practices that invade users’ privacy.

More than 40 European rivals to Google’s shopping service urged EU antitrust regulators to use newly adopted tech rules to ensure the Alphabet unit complies with a 2017 EU order to allow more competition on its search page.
The European Commission fined Google 2.4 billion euros ($2.33 billion) five years ago and told the firm to stop favouring its shopping service.
The company subsequently said it would treat its own shopping service the same as competitors when they bid in an auction for adverts in the shopping box that appears at the top of a search page.
But in a letter to EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, the 43 companies – which include British firm Kelkoo, France’s LeGuide Group, Sweden’s PriceRunner and Germany’s idealo – said the proposal was legally insufficient and had not led to them benefitting from the advert auctions.
“The Commission needs to re-open space on general search results pages for the most relevant providers, by removing Google’s Shopping Units that allow no competition but lead to higher prices and less choice for consumers and an unfair transfer of profit margins from merchants and competing CSSs to Google,” the companies said in the letter seen by Reuters. CSSs refer to Comparison Shopping Services.
They said Google’s mechanism breaches the Digital Markets Act (DMA), Vestager’s new rules aimed at reining in the power of tech giants, which will apply in May next year.

106,"October 13, 2022",Sources: Google May Face Antitrust Charges for Adtech Practices,"


Alphabet’s Google unit may face EU antitrust charges next year regarding its digital advertising business, which means that the company is at risk for its fourth billion-euro plus fine, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Google’s ad business, which has already generated around $100 billion in sales so far this year, is Alphabet’s biggest moneymaker, accounting for roughly 80% of the company’s annual revenue. This remains true despite the company’s efforts over the past decade to push into selling hardware, subscription services, and cloud computing technology.
Google’s dominance in the online advertising market has been increasingly scrutinized during recent years. Complaints from rivals about alleged anti-competitive practices have incited antitrust investigations on five continents concerning the company’s practices.
The European Commission has asked third parties to delete confidential details within their submissions, which is usually a precursor towards allowing Google access to documents following the a statement of objections, one person said.

107,"October 10, 2022",Epic Games & Match To Bring New Antitrust Allegations Against Google,"


Epic Games and Match are attempting to expand their lawsuits against Google to include additional allegations against the search giant. In a motion filed on Friday with a federal court in the Northern District of California, the two companies accused Google of paying off developers that had the means and ability to create competing Android app stores.
Specifically, Epic and Match point to agreements like Project Hug. The initiative, later called the “Apps and Games Velocity Program,” saw Google spend millions of dollars to keep some of Android’s most popular developers on the Play Store, according to a complaint filed by Epic last year.
“Some of these agreements were intended to, and did, stop developers from launching competing app stores,” the motion states, adding Google committed a “per se” violation of the Sherman Act, the primary US antitrust law. Under the Sherman Act, per se violations don’t require a plaintiff to show how a certain behavior negatively affected the market since it’s generally accepted such actions reduce competition.
Google told Engadget it would oppose the motion. “Epic and Match are adding more inaccurate claims to their failing lawsuits and we’re looking forward to setting the record straight in court,” a company spokesperson said.
“The program on which Epic and Match base their claims simply provides incentives for developers to give benefits and early access to Google Play users when they release new or updated content; it does not prevent developers from creating competing app stores, as they allege,” they added. “In fact, the program is proof that Google Play competes fairly with numerous rivals for developers, who have a number of choices for operating systems and app stores.”

The case will be clubbed with two other ongoing matters against the search engine major where the allegations are substantially the same, according to the Competition Commission of India (CCI).

109,"October 5, 2022",Dark Clouds Gather – An Analysis of Apple and Google’s Restrictions on Cloud Gaming,"


By Damien Geradin (TILEC) & Stijn Huijts (Geradin Partners)
Cloud gaming represents a new model of video game distribution. It involves playing games that are streamed from a remote server (the cloud), and has the potential to revolutionize gaming as it is, at least in theory, device-agnostic, allowing AAA games to be played on any device with a connection to the internet. However, Apple blocks the emergence of cloud gaming apps on its Apple App Store, and Google, although not completely blocking them, still imposes restrictions on them. Apple’s prevention of cloud gaming apps has led the UK Competition and Markets Authority to make a Market Investigation Reference, which could lead to the authority imposing remedies on Apple.
This paper provides an introduction to cloud gaming and explains why it is an important development that offers huge potential for competition and innovation in digital markets. It then discusses Apple’s prevention of cloud gaming apps and examines Apple’s stated rationale for this policy, after which it also touches on Google’s restrictions. This is followed by a section that sets out other reasons why it may be in Apple’s commercial interest to block the emergence of cloud gaming apps, looking in particular at whether this may be linked to a desire to protect its position in the distribution of apps on iOS devices and its revenues from the sale of hardware. After this, the paper discusses how these restrictions have led to the UK Market Investigation Reference, and how they may be treated under the forthcoming EU Digital Markets Act.

The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has asked Amazon.com Inc and iRobot Corp for more information on the e-commerce giant’s $1.7-billion buyout of the Roomba vacuum maker.
In a filing on Tuesday, iRobot said the FTC had on Sept. 19 requested more details on the deal that was announced last month and would expand Amazon’s stable of smart home devices.
A group of about 20 pro-privacy and worker organizations have urged US antitrust enforcers to stop the deal, citing concerns about privacy and Amazon’s already powerful position in the smart home devices market.
The FTC probe began earlier this month and covers both head-to-head competition and whether the deal would illegally boost the e-commerce company’s market share in the connected device market as well as the overall retail market, according to a report from Politico.

According to statements from EU Antitrust Chief Vestager, Amazon may have to change its proposals to end two investigations into its business practices. This is following feedback from the agency.
During the summer Amazon said it would set up a data silo, preventing its retail arm from using data from its marketplace to make competing private label products.
It will also end preferential treatment for itself and treat sellers equally when ranking their offers for the “buy box” on its website that generates the bulk of its sales.
Vestager had given third parties until Sept. 9 to provide feedback before deciding whether to accept the proposals.
A group of 11 non-governmental bodies and pan-European consumers’ organisation BEUC have criticised Amazon’s offer, urging the European Commission to demand adjustments to it.
“We are now in the process of assessing that feedback, some of which pointed to potential improvements on several points,” Vestager told a conference in New York.
Vestager also addressed the European Commission’s investigation of Alphabet Google’s digital advertising business, saying she was cooperating with her U.S. counterpart on the issue.
“We are also in close contact with the DOJ (Department of Justice) in the context of our investigation of Google ad tech,” she said.

112,"September 14, 2022",California’s AG Files Antitrust Lawsuit Against Amazon,"


California’s attorney general filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon on Wednesday, claiming the retailer stifles competition and increases the prices consumers pay across the internet.
The suit is limited to California, where officials said Amazon had around 25 million customers, but if it succeeds it could have a broad impact across the country.
“If you think about Californians paying even just a little bit more for every product they purchased online over the course of a year, let alone a decade, which is what is at issue here, the collective magnitude of harm here is very far-reaching,” said Rob Bonta, California’s attorney general, during a news conference announcing the case.“The everything store has effectively set a price floor, costing Californians more for just about everything,” he said.
The lawsuit largely focuses on the way Amazon penalizes sellers for listing products at lower prices on other websites. If Amazon spots a product listed for cheaper on a competitor’s website, it often will remove important buttons like “Buy Now” and “Add to Cart” from a product listing page.

Amazon’s proposal to halt certain online selling and marketing practices in a bid to avert possible hefty EU antitrust fines should be rejected because it is weak and full of loopholes, a group of 11 non-governmental bodies have told EU regulators.
The criticism from the group, which includes LobbyControl, the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO), the Austrian Federal Chamber of Labour and the European Public Services Union, echoed those from pan-European consumer group BEUC last week.
“They are weak, vague and full of loopholes, leaving too much room for evasion and abuse by Amazon. Moreover, the proposed limitation of these commitments to five years, or indeed any time horizon at all, is unjustifiable,” the group said in a statement.
The NGO group urged the European Commission to force Amazon to split its marketplace from its retail and logistics operations in order to address concerns about its dominance and control over interrelated services.
It said the offer also falls short of tougher requirements imposed on digital gatekeepers under landmark tech rules that will go into effect next year.

115,"September 5, 2022",Amazon To Partner With Japanese Pharmacies In Pharma Deal,"


Amazon is considering entering the prescription drug sales market in Japan, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Monday.
Amazon plans to partner with small- and mid-sized pharmacies for the service, starting next year when electronic prescriptions are allowed for the first time in Japan, Nikkei said, citing people involved in the project.
Under this plan, Japanese customers will be able to order prescriptions online after online doctor visits for the first time next year. Major pharmacies and other Japanese companies are also working on similar programs that would give patients digital access to information on their medications.
Read More: Antitrust Chronicle™ – Healthcare
Prescription drug prices in Japan are set by the government, while the distribution system is highly fragmented, with 70 wholesalers nationwide and almost 60,000 pharmacies. 
Amazon first moved into the pharmacy business in 2018 with its acquisition of PillPack, a medicine delivery service. It launched its own pharmacy, Amazon Pharmacy, in 2020, reaping important profits from the increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Amazon’s move into healthcare has not gone unchallenged. Amazon announced plans in late July to buy One Medical, a concierge-type medical service with roughly 190 medical offices in 25 markets. Last week, the e-commerce giant said it would shutter its own hybrid virtual in-home care service called Amazon Care, a One Medical competitor, because it wasn’t meeting customers’ needs.

The US Federal Trade Commission has begun a review of the $1.7 billion takeover of robot vacuum maker iRobot by Amazon to assess whether the deal has breached antitrust law.
Reuters wrote that the iRobot review is “wide-ranging,” examining both head-to-head competition as well as whether the deal would illegally bolster Amazon’s market share in the connected device market as well as the general retail market.
The company announced the iRobot deal in August. The popular Roomba robot vacuum is iRobot’s flagship product.
Amazon has expanded its devices lineup with speakers, home security doorbells, cameras and more. With iRobot, Amazon could add another powerhouse to its connected devices array.
PYMNTS wrote about Amazon’s iRobot acquisition last month, when Amazon Devices Senior Vice President Dave Limp said a benefit of services like iRobot’s is to help people save time.
“We know that saving time matters, and chores take precious time that can be better spent doing something that customers love,” he said. “Over many years, the iRobot team has proven its ability to reinvent how people clean with products that are incredibly practical and inventive — from cleaning when and where customers want while avoiding common obstacles in the home, to automatically emptying the collection bin.”
The report noted that Colin Angle will stay as the CEO of iRobot, and he said Amazon “shares our passion” for building new innovations for people at home.

The Federal Trade Commission is investigating Amazon’s $3.9 billion acquisition of the primary health organization One Medical, a move that could delay the completion of the deal.
Both One Medical and Amazon received a request for additional information Friday in connection with an FTC review of the merger, according to a filing made with securities regulators by One Medical’s parent, San Francisco-based 1Life Healthcare Inc.
Amazon announced plans in late July to buy One Medical, a concierge-type medical service with roughly 190 medical offices in 25 markets. Last week, the e-commerce giant said it would shutter its own hybrid virtual in-home care service called Amazon Care, a One Medical competitor, because it wasn’t meeting customers’ needs. 
The One Medical deal, the first to be announced under CEO Andy Jassy, was another push into healthcare for Amazon following its acquisition of the online pharmacy PillPack for $750 million in 2018. Groups calling for stricter antitrust regulations quickly urged the FTC to block the merger, arguing it would further expand the company’s massive market power. 
The FTC has already been investigating the sign-up and cancellation practices of Amazon Prime and has issued civil subpoenas in that case.

118,"September 1, 2022",Magistrate Calls For Dismissal Of Amazon Ebook Antitrust Suit,"


Plaintiffs’ lawyers in an antitrust class action alleging that Amazon conspired with five leading US publishers to fix the price of ebooks argued in a new brief that a Manhattan federal magistrate erroneously disregarded obvious evidence of collusion when she recommended the dismissal of their case last month.
The basic facts presented in their amended complaint, in combination with elementary economic principles, are enough to justify their allegations, wrote plaintiffs’ lawyers from Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro and Sperling & Slater. Within the course of several months in 2014 and 2015, the plaintiffs’ firms said, the five big publishers – Penguin Random House LLC; HarperCollins Publishers LLC; Hachette Book Group Inc; Macmillan Publishing Group LLC; and Simon & Schuster Inc – each signed a pricing agreement with Amazon that allowed publishers to set ebook prices but locked in Amazon’s 30% “agency” fee for every ebook sale and guaranteed that Amazon’s prices could not be undercut by other ebook sellers.
Those deals, according to plaintiffs’ lawyers, accomplished what both Amazon and the publishers wanted: They cemented Amazon’s overwhelming dominance of the ebooks market while allowing publishers to jack up prices.
“Those allegations are sufficient under the Sherman Act to set forth a prima facie antitrust claim against Amazon, regardless of any horizontal agreement among the publisher defendants,” plaintiffs’ lawyers argued to U.S. District Judge Gregory Woods of Manhattan, who will decide whether to adopt the Aug. 3 report and recommendation from U.S. Magistrate Judge Valerie Figueredo. “The expected result under basic economic theory (and the result in fact) is what plaintiffs plead here: supracompetitive consumer prices.”

Meta has joined forces with Indian eCommerce company JioMart to give customers the chance to buy groceries within Meta’s WhatsApp chat.
Users in India can see JioMart’s full grocery selection on WhatsApp, add items to their cart, and pay within the WhatsApp chat, the companies said in a Monday (Aug. 29) press release.
“Business messaging is an area with real momentum and chat-based experiences like this will be the go-to way people and businesses communicate in the years to come,” Meta Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the release.
India has been an important front in the eCommerce war between Amazon and Walmart. The country has 1.4 billion people, with internet penetration steadily growing at 47% (it had been in the low single digits 15 years ago).
Amazon said earlier this year it wanted to build a logistics division in-house through its purchase of a 51% stake in Ecom Express, an Indian end-to-end logistics solutions firm, to speed eCommerce deliveries in the country.
Walmart, which operates the Indian eCommerce site Flipkart, announced in April it would give Indian manufacturers and trading companies an increased ability to expand around the world as cross-border sellers on Walmart Marketplace. That offering is part of the company’s goal of expanding its sourcing from India to $10 billion a year by 2027.
Meta, meanwhile, has worked with Jio’s parent company Reliance Technology since 2020. The social media giant invested $5.7 billion in the company, getting a 9.9% stake.

Amazon filed a lawsuit against more than 10,000 Facebook group administrators for allegedly brokering fake reviews, including one called “Amazon Product Review,” which had more than 43,000 members.
“Today’s legal action is the latest step by Amazon aimed at stopping fraudsters who attempt to post fake reviews in Amazon’s stores. In the past year, legal action from Amazon has shut down multiple major review brokers targeting customers in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, and Spain,” Amazon said in a blog post on Tuesday (July 19).
The lawsuit, filed in King County Superior Court in Seattle, Washington, claims that the Facebook groups allegedly orchestrate fake reviews on Amazon in exchange for money or free products. The groups reportedly recruit people willing to post incentivized and misleading reviews, according to Amazon’s statement.
While Amazon said it uses “advanced technology, expert investigators, and continuous monitoring” to detect fake reviews, the information coming from the lawsuit will help it identify the fraudsters and remove the fake reviews that haven’t been otherwise spotted.
“Our teams stop millions of suspicious reviews before they’re ever seen by customers, and this lawsuit goes a step further to uncover perpetrators operating on social media,” said Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon’s vice president of selling partner services. “Proactive legal action targeting bad actors is one of many ways we protect customers by holding bad actors accountable.”
Amazon has more than 12,000 employees worldwide hired to safeguard the eCommerce giant’s storefronts from fraud, abuse and fake reviews. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter are routinely swept for fraudulent reviews and activities, and anything untoward is reported to the individual social media sites, per the post.
Over 10,000 fake review groups on Meta were reported to the site by Amazon since 2020. More than half were removed, and others are being probed.

Facebook has asked a US court for eight documents created by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as part of their review of the company’s purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp, which the agency allowed to go forward.
The request was made late on Tuesday and comes in a lawsuit filed by the FTC that has asked the court to order both of those deals undone. Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014.
The FTC sued Meta’s Facebook in 2020, during the Trump administration, alleging that the company acted illegally to maintain its social network monopoly.
Facebook is fighting the lawsuit, and wants the materials as part of that fight. “Both the Instagram and the WhatsApp documents are almost certain to reveal that the FTC determined that each acquisition was unlikely to lessen competition or harm consumers,” Facebook said in its filing.
The company argued that the FTC had given the documents to the House Judiciary Committee when it probed the tech giants, also including Amazon, Alphabet’s Google  and Apple Current FTC Chair Lina Khan was on the staff of that committee.
“Any claim of privilege was waived when the FTC chose to voluntarily share the documents with House Judiciary Committee members and staff,” Facebook said in its filing.

123,"June 20, 2022",Facebook In US Crosshairs For Allegedly Accessing Medical Data,"
Meta is facing a federal lawsuit that says private medical data is being secretly shared with Facebook when patients access their healthcare providers’ web portals.
Bloomberg reported Friday (June 17) that the suit seeks class-action status and says the Facebook Pixel tracking tool redirects patient communications and other “secure” information without permission.
The suit lists its plaintiff as John Doe and seeks compensatory and punitive damages. Bloomberg, citing a nonprofit news organization The Markup, reported at least 33 hospitals use the Facebook tracking tool, which could violate federal health information privacy laws.
Meta was not immediately available for comment Friday afternoon.
The company is also facing a $3.2 billion fine in the United Kingdom stemming from allegations that it exploited data and abused its market dominance.
In January, a senior adviser to the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Liza Lovdahl Gormsen, said she was bringing the class-action case on behalf of British Facebook users who used the platform between 2015 and 2019.
The suit claimed Facebook earned billions of pounds through unfair terms and conditions, which forced users to give up valuable personal data to access the popular social network.
Facebook responded at the time by saying people who used its services did so because it was valuable for them, and “they have meaningful control of what information they share on Meta’s platforms and who with.”
But Gormsen argued there is a “dark side” to Facebook in that it allegedly abused its market dominance and placed unfair terms and conditions on users by collecting data through things like Pixel. This allowed it to build an “all-seeing picture” of internet usage, giving it detailed profiles of users.
This week also saw France’s antitrust watchdog approve commitments made by Meta regarding the French online advertising sector. The company has agreed to give access to its advertising inventories and campaign data over a five-year period.

The Competition Appeal Tribunal said Tuesday that it “unanimously dismissed” all but one of Meta’s arguments against the findings of the probe which ended with an order to unwind the deal. However, judges did find that the watchdog didn’t consult properly on certain aspects of the merger probe.
Following an in-depth investigation, the CMA had found that Meta’s purchase of Giphy would reduce competition between social media platforms and had already removed Giphy as a potential challenger in the display advertising market in the UK.
In an approval handed down today, the tribunal upheld the CMA’s decision on five of the six challenged grounds. In particular, the CAT had “no hesitation” in concluding that the CMA’s finding that the merger between Meta and Giphy substantially reduced dynamic competition was lawful.
The Tribunal only found in Meta’s favour in relation to the treatment of certain third-party confidential information. It considered that the CMA’s approach to disclosure in this case overly favoured confidentiality concerns of third parties.
Commenting on the decision, CMA Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said: “We welcome this resounding endorsement by the Competition Appeal Tribunal of the CMA’s approach to reviewing mergers that may harm innovation. Innovation is a vital part of the competitive process, particularly in digital markets.

125,"June 10, 2022",How Should Antitrust Deal With Facebook? A Stigler Center Panel Investigates,"
By: Utsav Gandhi (Pro Market)
This year’s Stigler Center’s 2022 Antitrust and Competition Conference, which took place in late April this year, looked back over its previous five editions while also looking ahead to what’s next in enforcement. There was one particular corporate behemoth that couldn’t be left out of the conversation: Facebook–a company that has not only seen its strategic focus pivot to the “Metaverse” and name changed to Meta, but also its revenue balloon in size while weathering multiple storms over the last few years, ranging from user privacy concerns to anticompetive behavior, to allegations of fueling genocide and subverting democracy, both in the United States and abroad.
The final panel at this year’s Stigler Center conference took stock of answering several questions regarding Facebook and antitrust: Presuming guilt on Facebook’s part, what is the theory of harm against its practices? What remedies are currently being implemented globally, what are they hoping to achieve, and how likely are they to succeed? 
Moderating the panel was Adam Lashinsky, a journalist based in Silicon Valley who has long covered technology and big business. Joining him was an internationally-focused panel, including: Michal Gal bringing in the perspective from Asia and Europe and her expertise in competition policy for small market economies; Nicolas Petit from the European University Institute and his extensive work on technology regulation from across the Atlantic; Matt Stoller, from his US vantage point as the Director of Research at the American Economic Liberties Project; and rounding off the panel, Stigler Center Faculty Director and co-organizer of the conference, Luigi Zingales. 
Petit kicked off the panel by laying the groundwork for the most ambitious tech regulation platform proposed yet by any jurisdiction globally: the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Impacting both the “social network” aspect of Facebook (and Instagram) as well as its messaging services of WhatsApp and Messenger, the DMA imposes a broad restraint on combining data across these services and collecting or processing data from third-party services, he said. It will force Facebook to require users to opt-in and provide consent for data collection, and notably does not make it less or more expensive for those who do not consent to provide data versus those who do. The DMA also opens WhatsApp up to interoperability in a bilateral model negotiated between the platform and the interoperator…

US Federal Trade Commission Chair (FTC) Lina Khan, who promised tougher antitrust enforcement, said she would not rule out a settlement with Meta’s Facebook, which the agency sued in 2020, but indicated there was a high bar for any agreement.
In an interview on Tuesday, she also criticized what she said was a large number of obviously illegal deals and added she was not a fan of agreements to remedy problematic mergers with asset sales. Nor does she like behavioral remedies, when companies pledge a particular policy change for a certain number of years.
Under former President Donald Trump, the FTC sued Facebook in December 2020 alleging that the company acted illegally to maintain its social network monopoly. Asked about the likelihood of a settlement, Khan said: “We’ve laid out the relief that we think would be necessary. I think you can yourself calculate the likelihood of Facebook willingly settling for some of that relief.”
The FTC has asked a judge to order Facebook to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram, in 2012, and WhatsApp in 2014.
“But of course, as an agency, we’re always thinking about, you know, preserving resources, how to think about settlements, the trade offs against pursuing litigation, but this is (an) incredibly important matter for the agency, and we’re serious about the relief that we’re seeking,” she added.
She was also critical of companies who brought mergers to the government that they knew could not win antitrust approval.

127,"June 1, 2022",Sheryl Sandberg Leaves Facebook After 14 Years,"


Sheryl Sandberg, one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent executives who helped build Facebook into a global tech juggernaut, is stepping down as chief operating officer of Meta, Facebook’s parent company.
Sandberg, 52, made the surprise announcement in a Facebook post on Wednesday, writing that: “When I took this job in 2008, I hoped I would be in this role for five years. Fourteen years later, it is time for me to write the next chapter of my life,” Sandberg wrote. “I am not entirely sure what the future will bring – I have learned no one ever is.”
Sandberg will stay on the board of Meta, according to the company. Javier Olivan, another executive at the company, will takeover as chief operating officer when Sandberg departs the role this fall.
Sandberg was a pivotal figure in helping grow Facebook from a free social network dreamed up in a Harvard dorm to one of the most dominant social media platforms in the world, with nearly 3 billion users around the globe.
Often referred to as “the adult in the room” during the early days of Facebook’s rise, she served as a seasoned No. 2 at company alongside co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, who was leading the company in his early 20s. Sandberg arrived at Facebook after years of working as a manager in advertising at Google.

128,"May 30, 2022",Facebook Owner Meta Updates Privacy Policy,"
The company formerly known as Facebook has produced a new revision of its Terms of Service and updated its privacy policy. The old Facebook Data Policy is now Meta’s Privacy Policy, rewritten “to make it easier to understand and to reflect the latest products we offer.” 
With this revision, Meta “is not collecting, using or sharing your data in new ways based on this policy update and we still do not sell your information,” according to the company. Instead, this update tweaks the language and adds examples to help people understand what each segment is about.
The company has previously been criticized by regulators and campaigners over its use of customers’ data. WhatsApp and some other products are not covered by the update. Meta says the changes won’t allow it to “collect, use or share your data in new ways”.There are, however, two changes to the way that users can control how their information is processed. 
A new setting will give people more control over who can see their posts by default. And existing controls over which adverts users can see are consolidated into a single interface.
Michel Protti, Meta’s chief privacy officer, said in a blog post it wanted “to better explain what is expected from us and those who use our platforms”. 
He said that would include when the company may disable or terminate accounts, and extra details about what happens when an account is deleted.
Meta says it is also providing more details about the types of third parties with whom it shares and receives information, and how data is shared between its products.

129,"May 4, 2022",Facebook Faces New Tough Rules From German Watchdog,"


Germany’s cartel office said that Meta Platforms Inc, the owner of Facebook, has “paramount significance for competition across markets”, a classification which gives the regulator more leeway to curb digital companies’ market power.
Under legislation introduced by German lawmakers in early 2021, the cartel office can ban what it deems to be anti-competitive activities.
Meta, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, operates a strong, ad-supported social media ecosystem that continues to expand and is used by a large portion of the population in Germany, the cartel office said in a statement on Wednesday.
It said the new classification would form the basis for a more rapid conclusion of ongoing antitrust proceedings against Meta.
In 2019, the cartel office ordered the company to curb its data collection, saying the world’s largest social network had abused its market dominance to harvest the information of its users without their consent. Meta, then called Facebook, appealed the decision, and the matter is still pending in court.
The cartel office also initiated abuse proceedings against Meta in 2020 related to the links between its Oculus virtual reality products and the social media network.
A spokesperson for Meta said on Wednesday that the US-based company would comply with the cartel office’s decision on the classification.
“Even if we do not share the reasoning that has led to the Federal Cartel Office’s decision, we will continue to concentrate on providing our users in Germany with the best possible experience in keeping with all the laws and regulations,” a spokesperson for Meta told Reuters.

130,"September 20, 2022",Apple Increasing App Store Prices In Europe,"


Apple is raising the price of apps and in-app purchases in some countries in Europe and Asia as of Oct. 5, though auto-renewable subscriptions will be excluded.
“Your proceeds will be adjusted accordingly and will be calculated based on the tax-exclusive price,” Apple said in a blog post for developers on Monday (Sept. 19). “If you offer subscriptions, you can choose to preserve prices for existing subscribers.” 
The new prices will affect Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Sweden, Poland and all territories that use the euro currency, as well as Chile and Egypt.
“In Vietnam, these increases also reflect new regulations for Apple to collect and remit applicable taxes, being value added tax (VAT) and corporate income tax (CIT) at 5% rates respectively,” according to the post.
The reason for the increases in other countries wasn’t provided in the post, but could be due to a combination of a strong dollar against a weakening euro and yen, high inflation and interest rates and a weakened world economy.
Price hikes in the Euro market are roughly 20%, while the increases in Japan are about 30%, according to a reportin The Verge. The yen recently dropped to a new 24-year low against the US dollar.
The App Store pricing increases follow Apple’s move to raise the prices of the new iPhone 14 and Apple Watch Series 8 models in many markets outside the US.

131,"September 19, 2022",The App Association Representing Developers Funded Primarily By Apple,"


An association for app developers gets more than half of its funding from the same source that gives many of its members reason to gripe — Apple.
The App Association, known as ACT, calls itself the “leading industry voice on the app economy for our members as well as policymakers.” Its members and experts frequently testify before Congress, and earlier this month, it sent a letter to Congress outlining its top legislative priorities for the remainder of the legislative session. 
Apple not only funds the organization, but it is a background influencer that has a hand in forming the group’s policy positions, Bloomberg reported Monday (Sept. 19), citing four unnamed sources who previously worked at the ACT. The former employees also said the percentage of Apple’s support of the organization is much higher than 50%.
The association’s lobbying agenda closely aligns with Apple’s, Bloomberg reported, and it aligns even when it runs counter to what is in the best interests of developers. 
Rick VanMeter, a former congressional aide and the head of the Coalition for App Fairness, a rival association, told Bloomberg that the ACT is a deceptive organization because of its relationship with Apple.
“When you pretend to be something that you’re not in order to make a point, that’s bad for the lawmaking process,” VanMeter said, per the report.

132,"September 19, 2022",Court Rules DOJ Can Join Arguments In Apple-Epic Antitrust Trial,"
The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has been granted time to present its own oral arguments during the upcoming Apple v. Epic Games appeal, along with the State of California. 
On Friday, US Dept. of Justice officials filed a request to present 10 minutes of oral arguments during the trial, in addition to the 20 minutes of argument time per side. The lawyers said they wanted time to explain to the court the proper legal framework for evaluating the antitrust claims against Apple.
Though the Justice Department’s arguments will technically be in support of “neither side,” per court filings, its intention is to spell out its existing concerns over how the lower courts had originally ruled on the case. In an amicus brief filed back on January 27, 2022, U.S. officials indicated there were “multiple legal errors” in the district court’s analysis of US antitrust law, the Sherman Act, which could “imperil effective antitrust enforcement, especially in the digital economy,” the new filing explained.
Specifically, the DoJ had concerns over various aspects of that analysis, including how the lower court had too narrowly interpreted parts of the law, as well as other issues related to the lower court’s misunderstanding of the market and Apple’s monopoly power with regard to pricing, among other things. The lawyers asked for time to present these errors to the court and to explain how, if uncorrected, they could harm antitrust enforcement beyond this case alone.
The US’s request to join the arguments for this legal battle follows the news that the Justice Department is in the early stages of preparing its own antitrust lawsuit against Apple. Lawyers for the U.S. government have been interviewing impacted parties, including app developers large and small, and even hardware makers like Tile. It likely doesn’t want any decision in the Apple-Epic ruling to set a precedent in terms of antitrust law that could harm its own forthcoming case.
In addition to the DoJ request, the State of California also asked for time to present arguments in court in order to present its views on how the court should evaluate its consumer protection law known as California’s Unfair Competition Law.

The US Department of Justice has asked a US federal judge to participate in the upcoming appeals case between Epic and Apple, according to court documents seen by Reuters.
The Justice Department filed a brief to enter the case at the start of the year. The agency said it was concerned that Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers had improperly interpreted US antitrust law. Apple has argued that the district court wrongly decided the California Unfair Competition Law (UCL) issue.
 In 2019, reports surfaced that the DOJ was preparing to launch a probe of Apple’s business practices. A decision to uphold the company’s win over Epic could limit the DOJ’s ability to sue it for antitrust violations.

“The United States believes that its participation at oral argument would be helpful to the court, especially in explaining how the errors (in antitrust law interpretation) could significantly harm antitrust enforcement beyond the specific context of this case,” the Justice Department wrote on Friday.
The agency has asked for 10 minutes of the court’s time. Neither side is against the Justice Department’s involvement, though Apple has requested that the DOJ’s argument time count against Epic’s total time allotment or that the court extends the proceedings.

134,"September 16, 2022",Designating Large Platforms Under The DMA And The DSA: Comparing Apples and Oranges?,"
By: Konstantina Bania (The Platform Law Blog)
The Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) and the Digital Services Act (“DSA”) will soon start to apply. Broadly speaking, both instruments have the same objective, which is to address concerns arising from the increasing reliance on online platforms. However, despite being presented as parts of the same “package”, the DSA and the DMA do not have many similarities because they target different problems. The DMA imposes obligations to protect businesses and consumers against unfair platform practices. The DSA imposes obligations for a “safe, predictable and trusted online environment” through a framework for conditional liability exemptions and rules on due diligence obligations. In other words, the DMA primarily seeks to improve market conditions whereas the DSA, which is essentially content regulation, attempts to strike a balance between restricting the dissemination of illegal content online and the effective exercise of fundamental freedoms (e.g., freedom of speech, freedom to conduct business). The two instruments are also based on a different logic. The DMA only applies to “gatekeeper” platforms, that is, platforms that act as gateways between businesses and consumers. The DSA sets a baseline for all intermediaries and adopts a “graduated” approach whereby the rules become stricter depending on the category to which an intermediary belongs (intermediaries; intermediaries that are hosting service providers; hosting service providers that qualify as online platforms; and very large online platforms). 
However, the DMA and the DSA have certain similarities with respect to the regulation of the large service providers that fall under their scope. The entire text of the DMA and Section 4 of the DSA are based on the premise that “gatekeeper platforms” and “very large online platforms” (or “VLOPs”) pose unique challenges that can only be addressed through rules that target them specifically. Both instruments are based on user thresholds to determine the size (and, by extension, the power) of platforms that should be subject to such rules and they both envisage a designation process. Such similarities may be the reason for the misunderstanding that platforms that fall under the scope of the DSA will certainly abide by the DMA. This may not necessarily be the case because the definitional criteria, the designation process, and the methodology to calculate the size of the platform concerned are different. This blog post discusses this issue, detangling the conditions and the process pursuant to which a platform may qualify as a gatekeeper or as a VLOP under the DMA and the DSA respectively…

Apple may face yet another competition probe from regulators in Mexico, after a former telecommunications chief filed a complaint against tech giants on Friday.
The complaint, brought to Mexico’s telecoms regulator IFT on Thursday, has Mony de Swaan Addati accusing Apple and Google of “completely inhibiting competition, by abusing their App Store monopoly to force the use of their own payment services for in-app payments.
The complaint, seen by Reuters, claims the Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store charge between 15% and 20% commission, which in turn forces price inflation.Addati was previously the head of the telecommunications federation that existed before being replaced by the IFT.
He claims Mexico’s competition regulator declined to open an investigation into the matter, therefore prompting a turn toward the IFT over the matter.
“I have full confidence that (the IFT) will investigate and exercise its powers, in line with international best practices, so that these companies stop abusing their market power to the detriment of developers and consumers,” said Addati.

The founder of music streaming app Spotify has used a rare visit to Brussels to apply personal pressure on the European Commission for a case against Apple’s competition practices to be sped up.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Swedish billionaire Daniel Ek said he spoke with commissioner Margrethe Vestager about what he sees as Apple’s “anti-competitive conduct”.
“It’s a picture of a company that keeps zigging and zagging to avoid doing anything”, he said of the iPhone maker. Regulators in Japan, the Netherlands and South Korea that “have come down pretty hard on” Apple, Ek said, and he urged the commission to do the same.
Spotify filed a complaint before European regulators in 2019 claiming that Apple was taking a 30 per cent cut of its subscription fees for featuring it in the App Store and denying the streaming service the right to tell its users that other ways of upgrading were available. The European Commission only formally charged Apple with breaking EU law earlier this year.

Apple spent a record $4.6 million on federal lobbying during the first six months of 2022 as the technology company faced growing pressure from Congress and federal investigators over its alleged monopolistic behavior, an OpenSecrets analysis of federal lobbying disclosures found. 
The record lobbying spending puts Apple on pace to exceed the $6.5 million paid during all of 2021. The company spent nearly $2.7 million during the first quarter of 2022 – the most it has ever spent – and dropped $1.9 million during the second quarter.
But after years-long investigations by the Department of Justice, Congress and the Federal Trade Commission into alleged anticompetitive behavior by Apple and other Silicon Valley tech giants including Amazon, Google and Meta, POLITICO reported last week that lawyers at the DOJ are drafting an antitrust complaint against Apple.
Apple’s troubles have not been limited to the US. The company found itself in the European Commission’s crosshairs after Spotify complained that Apple unfairly restricted rivals to its own music streaming service Apple Music on iPhones.

Media regulators are looking into whether large US tech companies including Amazon and Google have formed a monopoly over cloud computing in Britain, officials said Thursday.
Britain’s media watchdog agency Ofcom announced the investigation and said it will look into whether the two companies and Microsoft may have an unfair competitive advantage in the cloud services industry.
“Because the cloud sector is still evolving, we will look at how the market is working today and how we expect it to develop in the future — aiming to identify any potential competition concerns early to prevent them becoming embedded as the market matures,” the agency said in a statement, according to the Evening Standard.
Specifically in the crosshairs of the inquiry are Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, all of which dominate global cloud storage services — a powerful tool that allows businesses to store data on remote servers accessible from anywhere as opposed to localized hard drives.
Depending on the findings of the investigation, the agency could take further action to rein in the corporate behemoths.
Other popular digital tools are also on the watchdog’s radar, including Meta’s WhatsApp, Apple’s Zoom and FaceTime and virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa — services that so far have seen little, if any, regulatory oversight.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) of the United Kingdom confirmed it is moving forward with a more in-depth investigation of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition. Sony has responded, praising the regulator’s decision.
The CMA announced on Thursday that it has referred the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard deal for an in-depth investigation, which the regulator calls a Phase 2 inquiry.
UK’s market competition watchdog released its initial findings last Sept. 1, saying the $68.7 billion deal could lead to a “substantial lessening of competition.” According to CMA’s rules, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard would have to present remedies within five working days to prove that their deal will not negatively impact the video game market in the UK.
In its reference decision published on Thursday, the CMA said it was informed last Sept. 6 that Microsoft chose not to provide remedies to the regulator’s concerns. This corroborated a report from the Financial Timeswith sources that claimed Microsoft did not expect the CMA to accept any commitments that would have prevented a Phase 2 inquiry. Per the timetable CMA posted, the in-depth investigation could run through March 2023.
Sony, one of the companies most vocal about the acquisition, praised the CMA for its decision. “By giving Microsoft control of Activision games like ‘Call of Duty,’ this deal would have major negative implications for gamers and the future of the gaming industry,” the company told GamesIndustry.biz. “We want to guarantee PlayStation gamers continue to have the highest quality gaming experience, and we appreciate the CMA’s focus on protecting gamers.”

UK officials have launched a deeper antitrust investigation into Microsoft’s $68.7 billion purchase of video game giant Activision Blizzard, reflecting concerns that the deal may lead to reduced competition.
The second-stage probe comes after the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Sept. 1 that the acquisition — which would make Microsoft the world’s third-largest video game publisher — posed a risk to markets including console and cloud gaming.
As part of the proposed deal, Microsoft could gain ownership of popular video game franchises, including “Call of Duty,” “World of Warcraft” and “Candy Crush.”
UK regulators have expressed concerns that the acquisition could allow Microsoft to restrict that valuable content from other gaming platforms, particularly Sony’s PlayStation.
Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In February, the company launched a charm offensive with regulators worldwide, announcing several commitments, including a promise not to give preferential treatment to content it owns on platforms it runs.
Earlier this month, the CMA gave Microsoft several days to respond to its preliminary finding with proposed solutions. On Sept. 6, Microsoft declined to make such an offer, the CMA said on Thursday, setting the stage for a phase-two investigation.
Under the agency’s practices, that deeper probe could result in a decision to clear the deal, to impose restrictions or divestitures on the acquisition, or to block the deal outright.

Microsoft’s $75bn acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard faces in-depth probes in Brussels and the UK following growing concerns the deal is anti-competitive and will exclude rivals from accessing the blockbuster game Call of Duty.
It comes as the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority is expected to launch an in-depth investigation this week after Microsoft decided not to offer any remedies atthis stage, according to two individuals with knowledge of the situation.
Earlier this month, the CMA became the first global antitrust regulator to sound the alarm over the transaction, giving Microsoft five days to come up with undertakings that would resolve its worries or face an extended “phase 2” probe.
The companies have already been in talks with regulators in Brussels since the deal was announced eight months ago, in what is known as the pre-notification stage — an indication of how scrupulous officials will be during the probe.
Regulators and others involved in the deal expect a prolonged EU investigation once Microsoft officially files its case in Brussels in the coming weeks. People familiar with the EU’s thinking say regulators will take their time to examine this deal because of its size, the nature of the buyer and the rising concerns from rivals, including Sony. “It is a big deal, a difficult deal,” said a person in Brussels familiar with the transaction. “It needs an extensive investigation.”

The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission delayed its decision on Microsoft’s planned $69 billion purchase of video game giant Activision.
The formal date of Sept. 15 for a decision has been delayed, according to a filing on the agency’s website earlier Thursday. The review started on June 16. The agency said the timeline was suspended pending receipt of information.
The news comes as the UK’s antitrust authority last Thursday said it plans an in-depth review of the Activision (ATVI) acquisition.
Activision CEO Bobby Kotick told employees in a letter last Thursday that he still expects the deal to close in Microsoft’s fiscal year ending in June 2023.
“We are fortunate to have already received approvals from a couple of countries, and the process with all of the regulators is generally moving along as we expected,” Kotick wrote in the letter.

147,"September 4, 2022",UK Watchdog Says Microsoft-Activision Deal Could Hurt Competition,"


The United Kingdom’s antitrust watchdog said Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard could hinder competition and warrants further investigation.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said in statement Thursday (Sept. 1), the deal — the largest ever for both gaming and Microsoft — could harm the industry if Microsoft were to block competitors from accessing Activision’s popular games.
“We are concerned that Microsoft could use its control over popular games like ‘Call of Duty’ and ‘World of Warcraft’ post-merger to harm rivals, including recent and future rivals in multi-game subscription services and cloud gaming,” the authority said.
Microsoft President and Vice Chair Brad Smith told PYMNTS: “We’re ready to work with the CMA on next steps and address any of its concerns. Sony, as the industry leader, says it is worried about ‘Call of Duty,’ but we’ve said we are committed to making the same game available on the same day on both Xbox and PlayStation. We want people to have more access to games, not less.”
Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer underscored this point in a company blog post: “We know players benefit from this approach because we’ve done it with ‘Minecraft,’ which continues to be available on multiple platforms and has expanded to even more since ‘Mojang’ joined Microsoft in 2014. As we extend our gaming storefront across new devices and platforms, we will make sure that we do so in a manner that protects the ability of developers to choose how to distribute their games.”

Britain’s competition regulator said it will refer Microsoft Corp’s  $68.7-billion acquisition of “Call of Duty” maker Activision Blizzard for an in-depth investigation.
The Competition and Markets Authority said the merger could reduce competition substantially in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services and cloud gaming services.
“Following our Phase 1 investigation, we are concerned that Microsoft could use its control over popular games like ‘Call of Duty’ and ‘World of Warcraft’ post-merger to harm rivals, including recent and future rivals in multi-game subscription services and cloud gaming,” the CMA said.
Both Microsoft and Activision said they will continue to cooperate with the CMA.
“Sony, as the industry leader, says it is worried about ‘Call of Duty’, but we’ve said we are committed to making the same game available on the same day on both Xbox and PlayStation,” Microsoft President and Vice Chair Brad Smith said in an emailed statement.

Amended licensing deals and other changes making it easier for cloud service providers to compete will take effect on Oct. 1, Microsoft said on Monday, a move triggered by complaints about the US software company to EU antitrust regulators.
Microsoft President Brad Smith had announced the changes in May but did not say when they would be effective.
The company, which has been fined 1.6 billion euros ($1.6 billion) by the European Commission in the previous decade for various infringements, found itself once again in the EU’s crosshairs following complaints by cloud service providers in Germany, Italy, Denmark and France.
“On October 1, 2022, Microsoft will implement significant upgrades to our outsourcing and hosting terms that will benefit customers worldwide,” the company said in a blogpost.
The revised licensing deals mean customers can use their licenses on any European cloud provider delivering services to their own data centers.

Media regulators are looking into whether large US tech companies including Amazon and Google have formed a monopoly over cloud computing in Britain, officials said Thursday.
Britain’s media watchdog agency Ofcom announced the investigation and said it will look into whether the two companies and Microsoft may have an unfair competitive advantage in the cloud services industry.
“Because the cloud sector is still evolving, we will look at how the market is working today and how we expect it to develop in the future — aiming to identify any potential competition concerns early to prevent them becoming embedded as the market matures,” the agency said in a statement, according to the Evening Standard.
Specifically in the crosshairs of the inquiry are Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, all of which dominate global cloud storage services — a powerful tool that allows businesses to store data on remote servers accessible from anywhere as opposed to localized hard drives.
Depending on the findings of the investigation, the agency could take further action to rein in the corporate behemoths.
Other popular digital tools are also on the watchdog’s radar, including Meta’s WhatsApp, Apple’s Zoom and FaceTime and virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa — services that so far have seen little, if any, regulatory oversight.

Such a move manages to cut staff without resorting to mass layoffs, but these reductions could be the set-up to a wider series of cuts as Meta looks to lower costs by 10%, according to the report. Some savings will come from reducing overhead and consulting budgets, but most will come from job cuts.

153,"September 20, 2022",Google Faces Trademark Suit By Analytics Platform Visier,"


HR analytics software company Visier sued Google for trademark infringement in San Francisco federal court on Monday, claiming Google’s Vizier machine-learning software is likely to confuse potential consumers.
Vancouver-based Visier told the US District Court for the Northern District of California that the similarity of the companies’ names and products could mislead consumers into thinking that Google’s software uses Visier’s technology, or that Visier is “simply reselling or repackaging Google technology.”
Visier asked the court for an unspecified amount of money damages and an order to block Google from using the Vizier name.
Google had no comment on the lawsuit. Visier and its attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.
Visier said in the lawsuit that its “people analytics” platform takes data and “applies cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to deliver insightful predictions.”
The company, founded in 2010, said one in three Fortune 500 companies use its software.
Google’s Vizier is a service for optimizing machine-learning models. Visier’s lawsuit said the internal Google software had been “relatively obscure” before being integrated with its Vertex AI machine-learning platform for developers last year.
Visier said it has discussed its infringement concerns with Google multiple times but was unable to resolve the claims.

154,"September 19, 2022",India Pressures Google To Regulate Lending Apps,"


Google has been asked by the Indian government and the central bank to introduce more stringent checks to help curb the use of illegal digital lending applications in India, according to sources.
Even though Google doesn’t fall under the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) ambit, the US tech giant has been called several times in the last few months to meetings by the central bank and the Indian government and urged to introduce tougher checks and balances that can help in weeding out such apps, according to four sources.
Indian regulators have already asked lenders to step up checks against illegal lending apps, which became popular during the pandemic. Regulators seek to control the proliferation of such apps that engage in unscrupulous activities such as charging excessive interest rates and fees or in recovery practices which are not authorised by the central bank or violate money laundering and other government guidelines.
Google said that last year it revised its Play Store developer program policy for financial services apps, including requiring additional requirements for personal loan apps in India effective September 2021.
“We have removed over 2,000 personal loan apps targeting India from the Play Store for violation of the Play policy requirements,” a Google spokesperson said, adding that such steps are taken if its policies are violated.

UK newspapers have this week been reporting that the law firm Humphries Kerstetter is planning to bring a class action case against Google in the next month, with a similar lawsuit being filed in parallel by lawyers in the EU.
The allegations against Google will be familiar to followers of the tech giant’s antitrust woes in the US, where the state attorney general office in Texas has been in protracted legal battles with Google since it first launched an investigation in 2020. 
That investigation threw light on the shady deal Alphabet made with Meta known as Jedi Blue, and is likely to have contributed toward decisions in the EU and the UK to launch similar probes this year.
Digital advertising is extraordinarily complex but the fundamentals are pretty easy to grasp. Websites possessing a few square inches of digital real estate need to match with advertisers willing to pay for the space. But publishers rarely negotiate directly with advertisers. Instead, intermediaries known as ad exchanges sit between buyers and sellers to match supply with demand.
The accusation against the current system is that Google has set itself up as buyer, seller, and marketplace, and is able to extract value from the whole process at each step of the way, often muscling out competitor services and driving prices up or down to increase its own profits.
In one notorious email unearthed by Texas investigators, a Google employee wrote that: “the analogy would be if Goldman or Citibank owned the New York Stock Exchange.”

Google Cloud has penned a multiyear strategic partnership with the healthcare company LifePoint Health in order to implement Google Cloud’s healthcare data engine in its hospitals.
LifePoint will utilize Google’s HDE to improve community-based healthcare delivery in the 29 states where the company operates. Clinicians will gain near real-time, globalized views of patients’ records as opposed to isolated data sets, according to a press release. With LifePoint’s far reach into rural communities, the partnership is expected to improve quality of care in historically marginalized populations, executives said. 
“LifePoint Health is fundamentally changing how healthcare is delivered at the community level,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, in a press release. “Bringing data together from hundreds of sources and applying AI and machine learning to it will unlock the power of data to make real-time decisions—whether it is around resource utilization, identifying high-risk patients, reducing physician burnout or other critical needs.”
Previously, LifePoint utilized myriad disparate electronic medical record systems.

It has not been a good news week for Google’s European business.
In a significant setback for Google’s attempts to overturn a 4.34 billion euro ($4.33 billion) antitrust fine, on Wednesday (Sep. 14), the European Union’s general court upheld a 2018 ruling against Google’s parent company, Alphabet, for unfairly taking advantage of the dominance of its Android operating system.
To make matters worse for the search giant, in the next big antitrust case on the horizon, the Guardian reported this week that Google’s practices in the ad tech industry could end up costing the company a further 25 billion euros ($24.96) billion in compensation thanks to class action lawsuits being brought in the Netherlands and the U.K.

Indonesia’s anti-trust agency (KPPU) said on Thursday it is investigating potential unfair business practices by Google over the use of proprietary payment services for its software distribution platform Google Play Store.
The move follows similar investigations by antitrust regulators globally involving Google.
“KPPU suspects that Google has conducted an abuse using its dominant position, conditional sales and discriminatory practices in digital application distribution in Indonesia,” it said in a statement.
An initial investigation found that since June 1 Indonesian app developers had been required to use Google’s payment system, which charges a 15% to 30% fee, the KPPU said.
The amount charged by Google Pay Billing is much higher than other services, which cost under 5% before the requirement took effect, it said.
If apps did not comply, they risked being removed from Google Play Store, it added.
KPPU said Google controlled a 93% market share in the country of 270 million people which has a fast growing digital economy.

160,"August 28, 2022","Amazon, Flipkart Lobby Against India’s Digital Lending Rules","


A number of large internet retailers, including giant Amazon and contender Flipkart, have begun to lobby against India’s new digital lending rules after the regulations interrupted card services and put Amazon loan offerings in peril.
Earlier this month, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a rule that said borrowers must deal directly with banks. This was  bad news for prepaid card loan providers, and other services that serve as loan intermediaries, Reuters reported Friday (Aug. 26).
“All loan disbursals and repayments are required to be executed only between the bank accounts of [the] borrower and the regulated entity without any passthrough/pool account of the lending service providers or any third party,” the central bank said in its announcement.
In addition, the Reserve Bank said fees paid to apps will now be covered by the lender, with no burden on borrowers.
The new rules have hit prepaid card offerings from companies such as Uni and Slice, which have teamed with banks and let users split purchases into interest-free repayments, a feature not offered with typical credit cards, Reuters reported.

The RBI has said the new regulations were to be implemented right away but noted that “detailed instructions will be issued separately,” according to the report.
However, Uni suspended its card services this week because of the RBI rules, while Slice has halted the issuance of new cards, the report stated.
Meanwhile, there are also concerns that the rules will hamper efforts by larger companies like Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart to expand their buy now, pay later (BNPL) programs, according to the report, which cited unnamed sources.

161,"August 25, 2022",DC’s AG Looks To Revive Antitrust Suit Against Amazon,"


DC Attorney General Karl Racine (D) filed a notice of appeal Thursday to revive the antitrust case against Amazon that a judge dismissed earlier this year. 
The lawsuit, first filed in 2021, alleges Amazon has used its position as a giant in the e-commerce field to maximize profits at the expense of consumers, third-party sellers and wholesalers. It accuses Amazon of using anticompetitive practices by keeping third-party sellers from offering lower-cost proxies for products elsewhere.
A judge dismissed the case in March in an oral ruling. 
“We’re appealing the lower court’s decision because District consumers deserve a fair marketplace that promotes competition, innovation, and choice,” Racine said in a statement. “And we’re filing this appeal because the antitrust laws and the facts are on our side—and on the side of District residents. We look forward to making our case before the Court of Appeals.”
The appeal is Racine’s latest attempt to push the first government-led antitrust case against Amazon forward. In April his office filed a motion asking the court to reconsider the ruling. 
The Department of Justice (DOJ) also urged the court to reconsider the decision to dismiss the case. DOJ attorneys wrote in an April filing that if “left uncorrected, the Court’s ruling could jeopardize the enforcement of antitrust law by improperly raising the bar on plaintiffs challenging anticompetitive contractual restraints in the District of Columbia.”

Peloton has made a deal with Amazon to sell its exercise bikes and other fitness products on the eCommerce giant’s platform as it tries to battle declining sales, according to multiple media reports Wednesday (Aug. 24).
The deal is the latest attempt by the troubled exercise equipment company to shore up sales as people begin going back to the gym after the pandemic. It represents the first time Peloton has teamed up with an outside retailer, thus far choosing to sell directly to the consumer via its website and brick-and-mortar stores.
Peloton Chief Commercial Officer Kevin Cornils told CNBC that Amazon was already seeing 500,000 a month for Peloton’s products, even though the company hadn’t sold its wares there until now.
“Post-COVID, the retail environment is continuing to evolve, and that’s something that we’re trying to understand better to make sure the Peloton of the future is calibrated appropriately for that,” he said. “We want to make it as easy as possible to get a Peloton.”
PYMNTS reported in February that Amazon was named as a potential buyer for Peloton back when the company was considering a sale.
At the time, Peloton had seen its value plummet from $50 billion in early 2021, driven by the pandemic and stay-at-home rules in 2020, to $8 billion.
The reports in February noted that Peloton linking with Amazon would also mean the sale of millions of users’ data leading to a possible shift in the health and wellness tech market. There are also several connections between Amazon and Peloton’s businesses, such as the fleet and logistics arm from Amazon which could help the fitness company with supply chain issues.

Amazon accused the Federal Trade Commission staff of taking “unusual and perplexing” measures in its investigation of the company’s Prime subscription business.
The FTC has been probing Amazon’s Prime business over concerns that it misleads how users sign up or cancel their Prime subscriptions. Insider reported in March on internal documents that showed “the company has been concerned since at least 2017 that user interface designs on Amazon.com have led customers to feel manipulated into signing up for Prime” but reportedly didn’t implement changes for fear they would negatively impact subscription growth.
An Amazon spokesperson at the time told Insider that Prime’s cancellation and sign-up process are “simple and transparent and clearly present customers with choices and the implications of those choices.”
Amazon is seeking to limit or quash civil investigative demands, similar to a subpoena, issued to the company and to individual current and former employees, according to the filing. It’s also seeking to quash CIDs issued to Bezos and Jassy, arguing staff has not given a legitimate reason for needing their testimony because it could obtain the same information it seeks elsewhere.
Lawyers for the company said in the filing that the FTC’s demand for Bezos and Jassy to testify at an investigational hearing “on an open-ended list of topics on which they have no unique knowledge is grossly unreasonable, unduly burdensome, and calculated to serve no other purpose than to harass Amazon’s highest-ranking executives and disrupt its business operations.”

iRobot agreed to be acquired by Amazon for $1.7 billion, according to a joint statement by the two companies on Saturday. If the deal goes through, it would give Amazon access to yet another wellspring of personal data: interior maps of Roomba owners’ homes.
iRobot got its start building robots for the US military, but 20 years ago added consumer vacuums to the mix. (It spun off the defense business altogether in 2016.) Those Roombas work in part by using sensors to map the homes they operate in. In a 2017 Reuters interview, iRobot CEO Colin Angle suggested the company might someday share that data with tech companies developing smart home devices and AI assistants.
Combined with other recent acquisition targets, Amazon could wind up with a comprehensive look at what’s happening inside people’s homes. The ecommerce giant acquired video doorbell company Ring in 2018and Wi-Fi router-maker Eero a year later. Speakers and other devices with AI assistant Alexa can now control thousands of smart home devices, including Roomba vacuums. And Amazon plans to acquire primary care chain One Medical in a $3.49 billion all-cash deal, which if approved would put the health data of millions in its keeping.
“People tend to think of Amazon as an online seller company, but really Amazon is a surveillance company. That is the core of its business model, and that’s what drives its monopoly power and profit,” says Evan Greer, director of the nonprofit digital rights organization Fight for the Future. “Amazon wants to have its hands everywhere, and acquiring a company that’s essentially built on mapping the inside of people’s homes seems like a natural extension of the surveillance reach that Amazon already has.”

Judd Smith, a senior Republican staffer on the Senate Judiciary Committee who was instrumental in drafting legislation to rein in tech giants, is leaving to take a job as a lobbyist for Amazon Web Services, according to two people briefed on the matter.
Smith’s move is particularly notable because the legislation he was working on — the American Innovation and Choice Online Act — is losing steam. Its sponsors are pushing for a floor vote, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has so far resisted their pleas.
The bill would ban Big Tech companies like Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta from favoring their own services in an anticompetitive way, similar to a House bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee as part of a marathon markup last summer.
Read On: Proposed Antitrust Reforms in Big Tech: What Do They Imply for Competition and Innovation?
Smith was one of the main Republican staffers working to draft the bipartisan legislation led by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to curtail the power of Amazon, Google, Apple, Meta and Microsoft.
The legislation — the most serious attempt at tightening oversight of the tech industry in years — would bar those companies from prioritizing their products over their competitors who rely on those companies to reach customers. Amazon, for example, would be barred from promoting its own private-label products over rival items on its e-commerce platform.
Legislation aimed at reining in the power of giant technology companies appears to have hit a wall after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told a group of donors he doesn’t believe there are enough votes to pass the measure.

Amazon is offering to halt the online selling and marketing practices in Europe that regulators allege are anti-competitive, hoping to bring an end to a two-year investigation and avoid a massive fine.
But as the tech and eCommerce giant offered a legal commitment in Europe, it does not yet face the same pressure in Australia, where Amazon’s foothold doesn’t meet the market dominance threshold and rules targeting the practice are years away.
Australian regulators are still concerned, however, because of the rapid growth of Amazon’s retail business in Australia and are “closely following” the European case as new rules for digital platforms loom.
Amazon Australia declined to say if the European offer – which includes a legal commitment to not use other sellers’ data for its own competitive retail business – would be applied locally.
But the local arm insisted it does not advantage its own products over Australian third-party sellers it competes with when generating $1.3 billion in Australian sales annually.

Motherboard revealed that Facebook’s systems are designed in such a way that the company can struggle to track users’ data within its own systems, according to VICE.
After Motherboard published the document, several US and European lawmakers called for stronger oversight of the tech giant to make sure it complies with existing regulations, such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and California’s Consumer Privacy Act, and even more government regulations to protect users’ privacy.
Democratic Sen. Ed Markey, who is a member of the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security, told Motherboard in a statement that “leaked document after leaked document show that Big Tech continues to play fast and loose with users’ personal information.”
“I’m concerned that these revelations are much more than simply a breach of consumer trust but an open door for specific threats of harmful data uses,” he added in the emailed statement. 
The document was written in 2021 by Facebook privacy engineers, who warn that they “can’t confidently make controlled policy changes or external commitments such as ‘we will not use X data for Y purpose.’ And yet, this is exactly what regulators expect us to do,” and that “there are tens-of-thousands of uncontrolled data ingestion points into Ads systems today.”
The engineers used an eloquent metaphor to explain the challenges the company is facing.
“We’ve built systems with open borders. The result of these open systems and open culture is well described with an analogy: Imagine you hold a bottle of ink in your hand. This bottle of ink is a mixture of all kinds of user data ([Third party data], [First party data], [Sensitive categories data], Europe, etc.) You pour that ink into a lake of water (our open data systems; our open culture) … and it flows … everywhere,” the document read. “How do you put that ink back in the bottle? How do you organize it again, such that it only flows to the allowed places in the lake?”

171,"April 21, 2022","Apple, Amazon, Facebook Spend Big On Antitrust Lobbying","
Apple, Amazon and Meta spent record sums on federal lobbying through the first three months of the year as they fought bipartisan antitrust legislation, according to documents filed with Congress Wednesday night.
Apple spent more than $2.5 million on lobbying in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 71 percent from the same period last year. Meta spent nearly $5.4 million, up 13 percent from last year’s first quarter. Amazon shelled out nearly $5 million, a 4 percent increase.
The rise comes as the big four tech firms attempt to derail the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, a bill to prevent dominant digital platforms from favoring their own services and empower antitrust officials to more aggressively investigate tech giants.
Tech giants, along with tech-backed lobbying groups and former national security officials, have increasingly cited China and Russia in their effort to defeat the bill, claiming that the measure would strengthen U.S. adversaries by weakening the nation’s tech giants.
Apple and Google are leading the charge against the Open App Markets Act, which would block app stores from favoring their own apps in searches, requiring developers to use their payment systems and blocking users from using third-party app stores.  
Apple CEO Tim Cook has personally lobbied lawmakers to drop the latter measure and warned last week that it would “undermine privacy and security” of Apple users.
Google, whose CEO has also pushed back on the bill, spent nearly $3 million on lobbying in the first quarter, up 10 percent from the same period last year but down from previous years.

172,"April 21, 2022",Facebook v. Bundeskartellamt – May European Competition Agencies Apply the GDPR?,"
The relationship between privacy and competition law is complex and contentious. May or should competition agencies consider business conduct’s negative impact on privacy when this effect was the consequence of a restriction or absence of competition? This contribution critically assesses the issues at stake in Case C-252/21 Facebook Inc. and Others v. Bundeskartellamt. It argues that competition agencies should be allowed to consider the legality of business conduct under the GDPR when applying competition law. In the age of data-based business models, it is unhelpful to look at competition and privacy issues in isolation. Judicious regulation of digital platforms requires an interdisciplinary and interinstitutional approach.

By Anne C. Witt[1]
 
I. INTRODUCTION
Privacy and competition law have long been considered separate areas of law, guided by different objectives and enforced by different agencies. Competition law aims to protect competition, and privacy law aims to protect the personal information of individuals. In the age of data-driven business models, however, where consumers receive free services in exchange for their data, the dividing lines have become blurred. If a digital platform restricts competition by foreclosing competitors or acquiring a competitive threat, and is consequently able to degrade its privacy standards, is this a relevant form of harm within the meaning of competition law? If a dominant platform uses its near monopoly position to...

173,"April 18, 2022",State AGs’ Antitrust Appeal Against Facebook Moves Forward,"


A 52-page reply filed by the attorneys general of almost all 50 states pressed the DC Circuit to let their antitrust case against Facebook proceed. Last week’s filing primarily addressed the trial court’s dismissal based on its application of the doctrine of laches and finding the states’ claims unreasonably tardy.
In January, the attorneys general urged the appellate court to override their case’s dismissal with prejudice. Facebook fired back, asserting that the states’ claims were untimely and the challenged policies were lawful when in effect.
In March, amici chimed in on Facebook’s behalf, backing its laches’ defense and arguing that if accepted, the states’ theory of liability would stretch antitrust law to impermissible extremes.
The states’ reply brief opened by noting that Facebook’s own CEO said that the company sought to “‘build a competitive moat’ around its monopoly.” The attorneys general then highlighted their role protecting the public from abuses of competition and urged that just as laches does not apply to the federal government, it should not apply to them.
The states, led by New York AG Letitia James, have also argued the judge wrongly dismissed their case, which alleged Facebook, now known as Meta, illegally maintained monopoly power and made unlawful acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp to foreclose competition.
The filing argued that courts have recognized states’ rights to sue in parens patriae under federal law, citing a District of Massachusetts case, and also pointing to suits brought by states under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). 
A footnote explained that like the Clayton Act, CERCLA permits any “person” to seek recovery, and “person” is defined to include states. The argument continued that CERCLA, just like the Clayton Act, does not and need not create a separate or exclusive cause of action for states.
In December 2020, Attorney General James and the coalition filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to stop Facebook’s anticompetitive conduct. The company filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted by the court in summer 2021.

174,"April 7, 2022","Canada Will Force Google, Facebook To Pay For News","


Canada’s government announced a new legislative proposal on Tuesday (April 5) that would compel platforms like Facebook and Google to negotiate with news publishers and pay them for using their content. 
By enacting this new legislation, Canada joins other countries, including Australia, France and Spain, that require Big Tech to negotiate with news publishers and pay for their content. Other countries like the UK could adopt soon similar legislation.
Under the new “Online News Act” firms like Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and Facebook parent Meta, would be required to pay Canadian media publishers for permitting connections to news content on their platforms. Canadian publishers have long lobbied the government for such a move, claiming that the advertising revenue that used to be the lifeblood of their operations has disproportionately migrated to global web behemoths.
The proposed legislation, according to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, would be comparable to Australia’s law, but would include public reporting requirements and give an independent committee, rather than the minister, the power to choose which enterprises are eligible for payments.
Read On: The European and U.S. Approaches to Antitrust and Tech: Setting the Record Straight
Australia was one of the first countries to adopt a law forcing Alphabet and Meta to pay media companies for content on their platforms, and it has been used by other countries as a model to follow. However, the Australian law goes somewhat further than other legislations, including Europe’s. For instance, in European countries like in France or Spain, Alphabet and Meta can negotiate with individual publishers, but it is up to the parties to reach an agreement and set the terms.
In contrast, Australia’s law kicks in only when negotiations between the tech giants and media companies fail. The legislation establishes an arbitration system that may impose binding rulings on the prices Google and Facebook must pay news publishers for content hosted on their platforms. Additionally, before updating algorithms that have an influence on traffic to news websites, the platforms are required give at least 14 days’ notice. Last, if any corporation violates non-discrimination terms, financial penalties may be applied.
The Canadian law seeks to replicate this model, but if negotiations between platforms and news publishers fail, a binding arbitration process will determine the compensation, rather than the government. The new law would exclude YouTube as this fall under the country’s broadcasting laws. The law will not apply either to Apple News that already license articles from publishers.
More countries around the world are trying to “level the playing field” between Big Tech and media companies. The U.K. announced in January that it is drawing up laws to require Alphabet and Meta to pay newspapers and media for their stories. Similar to the Canadian law, an independent arbitrator would step in to set a fair price if an agreement cannot be reached.

By: Gina Lodolo (African Antitrust)
On 14 March 2022, the South African Competition Commission (“Commission”) referred a complaint against Meta Platforms Inc is the parent company of WhatsApp Inc (“WhatsApp”) and Facebook South Africa (hereafter jointly “Meta”), to the Competition Tribunal (“Tribunal”) for allegedly engaging in abuse of dominance.
The referral follows WhatsApp (as part of the  Meta group) attempting to off-board GovChat from the WhatsApp platform. GovChat is a chatbot service connecting government to millions of citizens on issues of public concern (e.g. information on COVID-19 vaccinations and social grants). GovChat is reliant on the WhatsApp platform to function and connect users, without which its entire existence will be prejudiced.
GovChat utilizes WhatsApp for their services due to WhatsApp’s scale and consumer reach, however, Meta has attempted to off-board GovChat by placing reliance on WhatsApp’s terms and conditions to enforce a restriction against monetisation of confidential information through the use of consumer data obtained on the platform.
In this regard, the Commissions media release notes that “Facebook has imposed and/or selectively enforced exclusionary terms and conditions regulating access to the WhatsApp Business API, mainly restrictions on the use of data”.

The US Chamber of Commerce, perhaps the most powerful lobbying group in the United States, filed a brief on Monday March 28 urging a DC court to reject an appeal by a group of US states hoping to revive their antitrust lawsuit against Meta Platform’s Facebook, reported Reuters.
The Chamber, which represents over three million businesses, along with the Computer and Communications Industry Association and Business Roundtable, argued that the district court judge hearing the case was right to toss it out because the states had waited too long to file their case.
The states, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, have argued the judge wrongly dismissed their case, which charged Facebook, now known as Meta, with  Deploying a buy-or-bury scheme and exclusionary conduct, illegally maintaining monopoly power and making predatory acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp to foreclose competition.
Judge James Boasberg of the US District Court for the District of Columbia last July dismissed the states’ lawsuit against Facebook, saying they delayed in challenging the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014 respectively.
Boasberg, who also dismissed a lawsuit filed by the US Federal Trade Commission, allowed the agency to refile its complaint but did not do so for the states.

177,"March 14, 2022",South African Watchdog Goes After Facebook For Abusing Its Dominance,"
Meta’s Facebook and WhatsApp has been found to be anticompetitive by South Africa’s Competition Commission, which has referred the social giant to the Competition Tribunal “for prosecution… for abuse of dominance”. 
It could result in Meta, Facebook and WhatsApp being fined “10% of their collective turnover” in the country. The case refers to a South African messaging service called GovChat, a technology start-up which allows the country’s government to connects with citizens using the WhatsApp Business API.
“The commission found that the harm to the competitive process is also clear because the decision to off-board GovChat from the WhatsApp Business API and the exclusionary terms for access to the WhatsApp Business API, including restrictions on the use of data, limits innovation and the development of new products and services,” the Competition Commission said in a statement.
The WhatsApp Business API enables medium and large businesses (and government) to, among other things, message at scale, makes use of advanced automation, integrations with existing eCommerce, building chatbots and tracking metrics.
GovChat launched a platform in 2018 called the GovChat which enables the public to engage with all spheres of government – national, provincial, and local – to report a wide variety of issues such as pothole location and other service delivery requirements.
GovChat also enables government to disseminate critical information to the public en masse such as information related to Covid-19 system tracking, testing and vaccination. GovChat has also enabled the poor to apply on-line for social relief and distress grants. The GovChat has provided government with unprecedent insight into service delivery issues in real time and provides government with the ability to provide targeted solutions more efficiently.

178,"March 13, 2022","EU Launches Antitrust Probe On Google, Facebook Over Ad Deal","


The European Commission has formally opened an antitrust probe into a 2018 deal between tech giants Google and Facebook allegedly aimed at cementing their dominance over the online advertising market, reported Bloomberg. 
The EU’s executive said it was investigating the so-called “Jedi Blue” agreement to see if it had been used to “restrict and distort competition in the already concentrated ad tech market.”
The European Commission announced its formal antitrust investigation in a press release in which it voiced its concerns that an agreement between the two companies in 2018 may have breached EU competition rules. 
Meanwhile, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that the deal may have restricted or prevented the uptake of header bidding services.
The Jedi Blue agreement came under fire in the United States in September 2021, after four members of Congress asked the Justice Department to launch a criminal investigation into whether the pact violated federal antitrust laws.
Header bidding is a service that allows sellers like news publishers to offer their online advertising space to multiple buyers at the same time as opposed to doing so on an individual basis. This makes it so that buyers (or in this case advertisers) must compete against each other for ad space while publishers can compare bids from multiple buyers at the same time.

179,"March 11, 2022",CMA Probes Google & Facebook Over Ad Tech,"
The UK’s CMA is taking a closer look at Google and Meta’s conduct over concerns that they hampered competition in markets for online display advertising services.
CMA Chief Executive said “We will not shy away from scrutinising the behaviour of big tech firms while we await powers for the Digital Markets Unit.”
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is focusing on whether the companies restricted or prevented the uptake of header bidding services and whether Google also affected the ability of other firms to compete with its products in this area.
Header bidding is a service which allows sellers, such as news publishers, to offer their online advertising space to multiple buyers at the same time, rather than receiving offers one by one. As a result, buyers – or advertisers – compete against each other for ad space and publishers can compare bids from multiple buyers simultaneously. This competition between buyers can make auctions more competitive.
As part of its investigation, the CMA will consider whether an agreement between Google and Meta (previously Facebook) – which Google internally codenamed “Jedi Blue” – broke the law. This secret pact was the focus of an investigation in the United States looking into the claim that Google executives “induced” senior Facebook staff to agree to a plan to undermine competition in digital advertising.
The CMA is also scrutinising Google’s conduct in relation to header bidding services...

Tinder-owner Match Group has filed an antitrust case against Apple with the competition regulator in India, accusing it of “monopolistic conduct” that forces developers to pay high commissions for in-app purchases, a legal filing seen by Reuters shows.
Apple is fending off a raft of antitrust challenges around the globe and Match’s July filing adds to two other cases in India though Match is the first foreign company to mount such a challenge against the iPhone maker in the country.
Apple and the Competition Commission of India (CCI) did not respond to Reuters queries, while a Match spokesperson declined to comment on its filing.
In the previously unreported India filing, Match argues Apple’s conduct restricts innovation and development of app developers that offer digital services by enforcing the use of its proprietary in-app purchase system and “excessive” 30% commission.
A similar dispute in the Netherlands resulted in a 50 million euro fine for Apple and an agreement to allow different payment methods in Dutch dating applications.

“We’re fresh off the heels of our hard-won settlement with Apple and ready to get back in the ring,” said Steve Berman, managing partner of Hagens Berman and an attorney representing the proposed class of iOS developers. “Our firm is happy to see iOS developers from other countries seeking the same justice we were able to achieve for U.S. developers. We believe they too have been wrongfully subjected to the stifling policies of Apple’s App Store, and we intend to hold Apple to the law.”

In Snap’s earnings results announced Thursday (July 21), the social media company recorded its weakest-ever quarterly sales growth, where sales were up 13% year on year to $1.1 billion.
But beyond the top-line growth deceleration, where years ago that metric had been up triple-digit percentage points (and the compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, had been 50%), lies a deeper set of pressures that served to send the shares crashing nearly 40% Friday (July 22), extending a 10-month, 90% slump that has seen Snap’s market value shrink to $16 Billion from a peak of more than $140 Billion last September.
Yes, the company has decided to cut spending. Yes, the digital advertising market is seeing competition. But the steep drop, and the tens of billions of dollars in lost market cap has spread far beyond Snap, and the ‘sympathy sell-off’ seen across other platforms speaks to something larger.
Simply put, Apple has changed its privacy policies, and as a result, users can deny permission to be tracked.Indeed, as management noted in the Snap investor letter released Thursday after the market closed, “platform policy changes have upended more than a decade of advertising industry standards, and macroeconomic challenges have disrupted many of the industry segments that have been most critical to the growing demand for our advertising solutions. We are also seeing increasing competition for advertising dollars that are now growing more slowly.”
And during the question-and-answer session with analysts, Snap Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen said “the deceleration began with the platform policy changes implemented in Q3 of last year.” The changes are impacting the traditional models that are “used to drive the direct response to advertising business, as well as the tools used to measure the returns from that direct response advertising.”
Last year, Apple introduced its App Tracking Transparency system that lets users have the choice as to whether third-party apps can track them. The changes wrought to the iOS have helped to disrupt at least some of the activity seen with Snap’s advertising partners.

EU antitrust regulators are set to beef up an investigation into Apple, triggered by Spotify, with new evidence but not new charges, in the hope of speeding up the case, people familiar with the matter said.
The European Commission last year told the iPhone maker that its App Store rules, which require developers to use its own in-app payment system and also prevent them from informing users of other purchasing options, distorts competition in the music streaming market. 
Apple found itself in the European Commission’s crosshairs after Spotify had complained that the U.S. tech company unfairly restricted rivals to its own music streaming service Apple Music on iPhones.
The EU competition enforcer set out its charges in a so-called statement of objections or charge sheet.
The watchdog subsequently considered sending a supplementary statement of objections, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this year.
Such documents usually lay out new charges or changes to the original charges. 
The Commission is now expected to send a letter of facts to Apple instead, other people familiar with the matter said, adding that there was no final decision yet.
A letter of fact typically contains new evidence reinforcing the original charges against companies which can then counter with a written submission.

Moscow has long objected to foreign tech platforms’ influence in the Russian market, but the simmering dispute has escalated since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.
“The company has abused its dominant position in the iOS app distribution market,” the FAS said in a statement.
“Apple prohibits iOS app developers from telling clients inside the app about the possibility of paying for purchases outside the App Store or using alternative payment methods.”
Moscow has hit Western firms with a string of fines for violating internet laws that critics say are an attempt by the Kremlin to exert more control over the online space.

Apple Inc. filed its reply brief in its cross-appeal against Epic Games Inc. arguing that there is nothing wrong with its “anti-steering provisions,” guidelines that supposedly curtail certain freedoms of app developers and limit their communications with app buyers. Apple argues that the district court wrongly decided the California Unfair Competition Law (UCL) issue, remarking that it is the first time a court enjoined conduct it found unfair under the UCL but reasonable under federal antitrust laws.
The case, initially brought by Epic in August 2020, avers that Apple has illegally monopolized the iOS app distribution market, exacting a supracompetitive fee from its third-party developers for the privilege of offering their apps for sale in the Apple App Store. 
Last Thursday’s brief follows an initial appraisal by the Ninth Circuit that considered the trial court’s UCL ruling worth reviewing. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’ decision called Apple’s app distribution system a “black box,” and struck down the anti-steering provisions to enhance competition, transparency, and consumer choice and information while preserving Apple’s iOS ecosystem.

Apple also is being considered for examination. 
Under the act, which went into effect in January 2021, Germany can move fast to prohibit conduct that is anti-competitive, such as self-preferencing and pre-installation of services, per the report. 
To be subject to the rules, companies must be found to have “paramount significance for competition across markets,” according to the report. 
Elsewhere in Europe, Microsoft’s deal to buy Activision Blizzard is being looked into by the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority, Reuters reported in July.

Microsoft has alleged that Sony has a practice of paying developers “blocking rights” to stop games from being launched on Xbox Game Pass.
The statement has been filed in response to Sony’s recent comments on Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.

Questions surrouding concentration in the videogame console industry have grown over recent years as Sony and Microsoft continue their bitter rivalry for dominance in this lucrative market, particularly following the acquisition of major game developer studio Blizzard Activision.

Call of Duty is a massive, sprawling video game franchise that has sent players through dozens of battlefields ranging from the beaches of Normandy to the abandoned city of Pripyat to the frozen moon Europa. Now, it has become the staging ground for a new conflict brewing between Sony and Microsoft.
In January, Microsoft announced its intention to buy Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion. While the Federal Trade Commission has been scrutinizing the deal in the United States, Brazil also placed Microsoft under review by the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (or CADE), the country’s national antitrust regulator, and asked various gaming companies such as Ubisoft, Riot Games, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and Sony for comments on the potential merger. Out of the 11 companies CADE reached out to, Sony was the sole objector.
At the heart of Sony’s concern was Microsoft potentially owning Call of Duty, which Sony claimed would position Microsoft at the critical mass of a gaming monopoly. Microsoft had already gained some of gaming’s most revered franchises such as Fallout, The Elder Scrolls and Doom after purchasing ZeniMax Media in 2020. These high profile acquisitions have been integral to Microsoft’s plan to solidify the power of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service where users gain access to a rotating catalogue of downloadable games for a monthly fee.

Microsoft is rallying other big-name cloud-computing providers such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Oracle Corp. to press the US government into spreading its spending on such services more widely, taking aim at Amazon.com Inc.’s dominance in such contracts.
The software giant has issued talking points to other cloud companies aimed at jointly lobbying Washington to require major government projects to use more than one cloud service, according to people familiar with the effort and a document viewed by The Wall Street Journal.
he software giant has issued talking points to other cloud companies aimed at jointly lobbying Washington to require major government projects to use more than one cloud service, according to people familiar with the effort and a document viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Microsoft also approached VMware, Dell, IBM and HP said the people familiar with the effort. It hasn’t yet asked Amazon to join the loose alliance, the people said. Amazon dominates the cloud-infrastructure industry with a 39% share of the 2021 global market ahead of Microsoft at No. 2 with a 21% share, according to research firm Gartner Inc. Amazon looms even larger in the business of selling cloud services to governments. Amazon’s cloud had a 47% share of the 2021 U.S. and Canada public-sector market orders, ahead of 28% for Microsoft, according to Gartner. The National Security Agency last year picked Amazon as the sole vendor for a cloud contract that could be worth potentially as much as $10 billion over the next decade, renewing an existing business relationship.

Technology companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Netflix are being invited to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance’s hearings next week on alleged anti-competitive practices of big tech firms.
“We are extending invitations to Meta, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix and others. Even if  they are not able to attend, there will be representatives from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the Competition Commission of India (to communicate their own positions on the matter),” said Jayant Sinha, chairperson of the committee and a Member of Parliament from the Bharatiya Janata Party.
On July 21, the committee conducted a hearing that was attended by top executives of eight domestic tech firms, including Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma and OYO founder Ritesh Agarwal. Representatives from Flipkart, MakeMyTrip, Zomato and Swiggy also attended the meeting.
“We covered a wide range of topics as digital markets cover everything from e-commerce to ride sharing. After all the hearings are concluded, we will present our findings in a report,” said Sinha.
According to people in the know, there were discussions about widening the ambit of CCI’s powers with regards to the tech industry. Moreover, alleged unfair practices by big tech companies to further their dominance, commissions charged by tech platforms and allegations of predatory pricing also came up.

195,"July 24, 2022",EU Questions Microsoft-Activision Rival Access,"


European antitrust enforcers are asking whether Microsoft would shut rivals out from Activision’s popular video game library as part of a review of the tech giant’s planned $69 billion deal for the game developer, according to people familiar with the matter and documents seen by Politico.
The European Commission circulated questionnaires to competing firms in early July and officials have also been holding meetings with Microsoft’s rivals to discuss their concerns about the record-breaking deal, which is yet to be formally notified in Europe.
According to the Commission’s request for information, regulators are keen to know whether and “how Microsoft could selectively degrade the compatibility and accessibility of Game Pass” on rival platforms. Game Pass is Microsoft’s video game subscription service for Xbox and PC users.  
Competitors have voiced concerns over Microsoft potentially restricting access to some of Activision’s titles, such as Call of Duty,  for rival subscription gaming services if the deal is approved.
While the Commission’s formal review of a deal only kicks off once the companies file for approval, it frequently sends questionnaires during the so-called pre-notification period to gather information that lets it identify potential antitrust issues.

Netflix said on Wednesday it has selected Microsoft Corp as technology and sales partner for its planned ad-supported subscription offering, as the streaming giant looks to plug slowing subscriber growth by rolling out a cheaper plan.
Netflix announced in April that it would introduce a new, lower-priced version of its service in a bid to attract more subscribers. The announcement came as the pioneering subscription service posted its first subscriber loss in more than a decade, and projected deeper losses to come.
Chief Operating Officer Greg Peters said in a blog post that Netflix chose Microsoft because of its ability to innovate over time, as well as its for its strong privacy protections.
“It’s very early days and we have much to work through. But our long-term goal is clear. More choice for consumers and a premium, better-than-linear TV brand experience for advertisers,” Peters said.
Microsoft President Brad Smith has served on Netflix’s board since 2015.

The UK competition regulator on Wednesday announced the launch of an antitrust investigation into Microsoft’s proposed $68.7 billion acquisition of video gaming giant Activision Blizzard.
The probe into what would be Microsoft’s biggest acquisition in its history will focus on whether the deal may substantially lessen competition — or create expectations that it might.
Microsoft has previously said it expects antitrust officials to scrutinize how the deal, announced in January, may affect competition in the video game industry, app stores and even labor markets.
“We expect and think it’s appropriate for regulators to take a close look at this acquisition,” Lisa Tanzi, corporate vice president & general counsel at Microsoft, said in a statement Wednesday. “We have been clear about how we plan to run our gaming business and why we believe the deal will benefit gamers, developers, and the industry.”
“We’re committed to answering questions from regulators and ultimately believe a thorough review will help the deal close with broad confidence, and that it will be positive for competition,” Tanzi added. “We remain confident the deal will close in fiscal year 2023 as initially anticipated.”

Susan Athey, a Stanford University professor and former chief economist at Microsoft, is joining the Justice Department as its top antitrust economist.
Athey, an expert on the economics of internet platforms — particularly search engines and online advertising, joins the Justice Department as it prepares for trial against Alphabet’s Google and is pursuing an investigation of Apple and another Google case.
Because of her previous work, though, Athey is likely to be recused from the Justice Department’s Google and Apple cases, said two people, speaking on condition of anonymity about internal DOJ matters.
Athey consulted for Microsoft for almost a decade, aiding the company’s years-long antitrust fight against Google. More recently, she served as an economic expert for Epic Games in its antitrust suit against Apple related to the iPhone-maker’s mobile App Store restrictions.
In her work for Microsoft, Athey worked closely with Jonathan Kanter, the assistant attorney general for antitrust, who represented the Windows-maker in its antitrust battles with the DOJ in the early 2000s and later against Google.
A professor at Stanford since 2013, Athey previously taught at Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She resigned last month from the board of directors of Expedia Group, a position she had held since 2015.

199,"June 16, 2022",FTC Looking At Labor Impact Of Microsoft-Activision Merger,"


The Federal Trade Commission is investigating Microsoft Corp.’s proposed purchase of Activision Blizzard Inc. and how it might impact workers, chair Lina Khan told lawmakers.
In a June 9 letter to Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, Khan confirmed the agency is looking into the proposed deal, noting that the companies previously disclosed the FTC’s merger review.
“I strongly believe that merger investigations must scrutinize the impact on labor markets,” Khan said. “Whenever the FTC initiates a merger review, we are committed to thoroughly examining effects on competition in all relevant markets for potential law enforcement action.”
Khan’s letter was a response to a March 31 missive from Warren and other senators urging the FTC to closely examine how the proposed deal would impact workers at Activision, who have called for greater accountability at the company in the wake of sexual harassment and discrimination allegations.

200,"September 14, 2022",South Korean Watchdog Fines Google & Meta Over Data,"


South Korea has fined Google and Meta Platforms more than US$71 million collectively for gathering users’ personal information without consent for tailored ads, regulators said yesterday, the country’s highest-ever data protection fines.
Investigations into the two US technology giants found they had been “collecting and analyzing” data on their users, and monitoring their use of Web sites and applications, the South Korean Personal Information Protection Commission said.
The data was used to “infer the users’ interests or used for customized online advertisements,” the commission said.
Neither Google nor Meta had clearly informed South Korean users of this practice or obtained their consent in advance, the commission added.
As a result, Google was fined 69.2 billion won (US$49.7 million) and Meta 30.8 billion won.
“It is the largest fine for the violation of the Personal Information Protection Act,” the commission said in a statement.
Regulators said that the majority of the users in South Korea — 82 percent for Google and 98 percent for Meta — had unknowingly allowed them to collect data on their online use.
“It can be said that the possibility and the risk of infringement of the rights of the users are high,” the statement said.

The European Union’s General Court on Wednesday upheld an antitrust ruling against Google’s parent company, Alphabet, but reduced its fine to 4.125 billion euros ($4.12 billion) from 4.34 billion euros.
The dispute between Google and the EU courts is over whether it uses the Android operating system to quash competition, and was initiated against the company in 2015.
The court said it “largely confirms the European Commission’s decision that Google imposed unlawful restrictions on manufacturers of Android mobile devices and mobile network operators to consolidate the dominant position of its search engine.”
In a statement provided to CNBC, Google said: “We are disappointed that the Court did not annul the decision in full. Android has created more choice for everyone, not less, and supports thousands of successful businesses in Europe and around the world.” 
The initial fine was issued by the European Commission in 2018 and was the largest ever for Google. It said that around 80% of Europeans used Android and that Google gave an unfair advantage to its apps, such as Chrome and Search, by forcing smartphone makers to pre-install them in a bundle with its app store, Play.

A US federal judge ruled on Tuesday that online search engine giant Google must face all but one of the numerous antitrust accusations regarding its online advertising business that were brought in a lawsuit by attorneys general for Texas and 16 other states.
In 2018 Google filed and subsequently won a motion to dismiss allegations that a cooperation agreement it struck with Facebook in 2018 was an unlawful restraint of trade, with US District Judge P. Kevin Castel saying the companies had valid business reasons for the deal.

Google failed to convince judge Castel to dismiss three other counts related to the company’s market power, though the judge found that some underlying claims by the states lacked merit.
The antitrust case is one of several against Google and other big tech companies that could go to trial over the next couple of years.

The Texas lawsuit argues that Google has obtained and abused a monopoly over the labyrinthine set of systems that allow publishers to auction off ad space to marketers. The states have said that Google misled publishers and advertisers about the nature of these auctions, allowing it to pocket more of the money flowing through its systems. Furthermore, they say the company used a deal with Facebook – known as ‘Jedi Blue’ –  to maintain its dominance when the publishers tried to develop an alternative system.

203,"September 13, 2022",US Inks Deal With Google To Make Chips,"


The United States Department of Commerce announced on Tuesday that its National Institute of Standards and Technology has signed a research and development (R&D) deal with Google to create and manufacture semiconductors.
According to the department’s written statement, those chips will be used by researchers “to develop new nanotechnology and semiconductor devices,” and made by SkyWater Technology at their manufacturing facility in Bloomington, Minnesota.
“This is a great example of how government, industry and academic researchers can work together to enhance US leadership in this critically important industry,” Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and NIST Director Laurie E. Locascio commented.
Modern microelectronic devices are made of components that are stacked like layers in a cake, with the bottom layer being a semiconductor chip. The NIST/Google collaboration will make available a bottom-layer chip with specialized structures for measuring and testing the performance of the components placed on top of it, including new kinds of memory devices, nanosensors, bioelectronics and advanced devices needed for artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
NIST anticipates designing as many as 40 different chips optimized for different applications. Because the chip designs will be open source, researchers will be able to pursue new ideas without restriction and share data and device designs freely.
“Google has a long history of leadership in open-source,” said Will Grannis, CEO of Google Public Sector. “Moving to an open-source framework fosters reproducibility, which helps researchers from public and private institutions iterate on each other’s work. It also democratizes innovation in nanotechnology and semiconductor research.”

Google is being sued in the UK and the Netherlands where two suits have been announced today seeking damages on behalf of publishers who claim they have been harmed by anti-competitive adtech practices.
Per Reuters, publishers are seeking up to €25 billion in damages from Google for lost ad revenues via the litigation.
Google’s adtech has recently drawn scrutiny from antitrust regulators following complaints from publishers.
The French competition watchdog imposed a 220-million-euro fine on the company last year while the European Commission and its UK peer are investigating whether Google’s adtech business gives it an unfair advantage over rivals and advertisers.
“It is time that Google owns up to its responsibilities and pays back the damages it has caused to this important industry. That is why today we are announcing these actions across two jurisdictions to obtain compensation for EU and UK publishers,” Damien Geradin at law firm Geradin Partners said in a statement on Tuesday.

The agency did not say what specific products were allegedly imported in potential violation of US trade law. It said it had not yet made any decision on the merits of the case.

EU antitrust regulators have broadened the scope of their investigation into Google’s digital advertising business by taking over the Portuguese competition watchdog’s probe into the same issue.
While the European Commission kicked off its investigation in June last year, the Portuguese Competition Authority (AdC) only opened a probe in May this year following a complaint.
The Portuguese watchdog said the EU competition authority took over its case on July 27 in view of the scope and impact of the matter in question.
The Commission said it took note of the AdC’s announcement. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
AdC said its investigation focused on the market for publisher ad servers and the market for supply-side platforms, which allow publishers to manage the advertising space on their websites and to sell it through auctions or agreements with advertisers.
“There are indications that Google has used information not accessible by competitors on online advertisement auctions in order to change the outcome of those auctions in Google’s favour, and has possibly limited the development of competing auction technologies, among other competition restricting behaviours in the context of negotiations with publishers,” AdC said.

New internal documents released by the US House Judiciary Committee have revealed how Amazon, Facebook and Google favoured their own products and abused their dominance to suppress competition from their rivals.The new documents include internal Facebook documents, showing the company views itself as dominant in the social networking market and insulates itself from competitive threats.“Other newly-released documents include Google internal communications demonstrating how it leverages its control over the Android mobile operating system to prevent smartphone manufacturers from introducing products or services that compete with Google’s family of mobile apps,” the House Judiciary Committee said in a statement on Tuesday.Internal Amazon documents demonstrate how Amazon’s abuses its dominance over e-commerce to coerce third-party sellers to purchase other services from Amazon, such as fulfillment and distribution.“From Amazon and Facebook to Google and Apple, there’s no question that these unregulated tech giants have become too big to care and too powerful to ever put people over profits,” said House Antitrust Subcommittee Vice Chair, Pramila Jayapal (D-WA).“This report is clear: it’s time for Congress to act to protect consumers and promote competition. My Ending Platform Monopolies Act would be an important step towards reining in the power of Big Tech,” she added.The report came as the US lawmakers push to approve stronger antitrust legislation by the end of the year.The 450-page report details the findings and recommendations from a bipartisan investigation that included seven congressional hearings, the production of nearly 1.3 million internal documents and communications from the investigated firms and submissions from 38 antitrust experts.“The findings and recommendations clearly show that it is long-past time for Congress to enact meaningful updates to our antitrust laws to address the lack of competition in digital markets and the monopoly power of dominant platforms like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google,” said House Judiciary Committee Chairman, Jerrold Nadler (D-NY).“The public wants Congress to act, and there is legislation that is ready for a vote on the floor of both the House and the Senate.

Internal documents from Google and Amazon provided to Politico, show new examples of how the companies favor their own products over competitors’,  adding ammunition to the push for Congress to toughen antitrust laws.
The documents,  which include emails, memos and strategy papers, were shared by the House Judiciary committee, which obtained them as part of its long-running antitrust investigation of Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta that wrapped in October 2020 with a 450-page staff report. The documents were cited in the report, but had not previously been made available.
The documents bolster the committee’s claims that the internet giants illegally favor their own products, a practice that pending legislation to update antitrust laws would make more difficult.
“It is time for Congress to act,” Antitrust Subcommittee Chair David N. Cicilline (D-RI) said in a statement.
Heavily redacted internal Google documents appear to show, for example, how Google pressured mobile phone makers including Samsung to prioritize its own apps on their devices.
In a January 2014 email about recent meetings in South Korea with Samsung and LG, a Google executive describes “grave concerns” about a new Samsung service “competing with our core search experience.” Yet Google appeared open to Samsung launching a “smart assistant” service in China, where Google’s offerings are not available.
The newly released material, which also include emails and other documents from Amazon and Meta-owned Facebook, arrives as pressure is building on Congress, and in particular Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, to pass a bill that would block the internet giants from favoring their own products and services over those of competitors who rely on their platforms.

Amazon filed a lawsuit against more than 10,000 Facebook group administrators for allegedly brokering fake reviews, including one called “Amazon Product Review,” which had more than 43,000 members.
“Today’s legal action is the latest step by Amazon aimed at stopping fraudsters who attempt to post fake reviews in Amazon’s stores. In the past year, legal action from Amazon has shut down multiple major review brokers targeting customers in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, and Spain,” Amazon said in a blog post on Tuesday (July 19).
The lawsuit, filed in King County Superior Court in Seattle, Washington, claims that the Facebook groups allegedly orchestrate fake reviews on Amazon in exchange for money or free products. The groups reportedly recruit people willing to post incentivized and misleading reviews, according to Amazon’s statement.
While Amazon said it uses “advanced technology, expert investigators, and continuous monitoring” to detect fake reviews, the information coming from the lawsuit will help it identify the fraudsters and remove the fake reviews that haven’t been otherwise spotted.
“Our teams stop millions of suspicious reviews before they’re ever seen by customers, and this lawsuit goes a step further to uncover perpetrators operating on social media,” said Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon’s vice president of selling partner services. “Proactive legal action targeting bad actors is one of many ways we protect customers by holding bad actors accountable.”
Amazon has more than 12,000 employees worldwide hired to safeguard the eCommerce giant’s storefronts from fraud, abuse and fake reviews. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter are routinely swept for fraudulent reviews and activities, and anything untoward is reported to the individual social media sites, per the post.
Over 10,000 fake review groups on Meta were reported to the site by Amazon since 2020. More than half were removed, and others are being probed.

Amazon, in its attempt to ward off two European Union antitrust investigations as part of a sustained increase in scrutiny of the internet behemoth by major jurisdictions, has promised to take actions that will lead to treating third-party merchants on its website fairly, the bloc’s competition watchdog said Thursday.
The US-based online retail giant offered to make a number of commitments to ease competition concerns, and the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s top antitrust enforcer, said it will now seek feedback on them from “interested parties.”
The commission launched an investigation four years ago over concerns Amazon breached EU competition rules by using data from merchants selling products on its platform to gain an unfair advantage over them.
It also opened a separate investigation into whether Amazon favors its own retail business and merchants that use its logistics and delivery system over other sellers.

The investigations are part of the bloc’s wider efforts to curb the power of big technology companies. Amazon also is facing similar scrutiny in the US.
Amazon said that while it disagreed with several of the conclusions, it has “engaged constructively with the commission to address their concerns and preserve our ability to serve European customers and the more than 185,000 European small- and medium-sized businesses selling through our stores.”
The company also said it has “serious concerns” about new EU digital regulations, known as the Digital Markets Act, that it said are “unfairly targeting Amazon and a few other US companies.” The act, part of the EU’s overhaul of its digital rulebook, aims to prevent tech giants from becoming dominant by making them treat smaller rivals fairly under threat of hefty fines.
Under the commission’s investigation, Amazon had faced a possible fine of up to 10 percent of its annual worldwide revenue, which could have amounted to billions of dollars.

A new U.S. antitrust bill targeting Big Tech companies might be doomed to stay in the Senate if it doesn’t pass before Congress’ summer recess, Seeking Alpha reported Sunday (July 10).
Called the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, it was intended to cut back on tech giants’ ability to favor their own services over those of competitors. The legislation, which has backing from the U.S. Justice Department, could impact companies like Google, Apple, Meta and Amazon.
The act, sponsored by Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, could end up delayed as a previously waylaid reconciliation package takes over everyone’s attention, according to a CTFN report cited by Seeking Alpha.
According to Klobuchar, the bill has the 60 votes it needs to pass the Senate. However, the office of Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said it’s trying to still get the correct support for the bill in the Senate.
Per prior reports from CTFN, the decision for a floor vote for the bill will come down to whether Schumer will put the time into it or not. The report also noted that Republican senators could be looking at adding more amendments to the act to “complicate and delay” things, according to CTFN.
The debate over how to rein in Big Tech has been going on for some time, with much of the debate devoted to the American Choice and Innovation Online Act.
PYMNTS wrote that a big part of this debate is the question of how companies should or should not use their data — including things like not using the data to favor their own products or hurt competitors’. There are also questions over who will have access to the data and where it should be shared.

217,"July 6, 2022",German Watchdog Subjects Amazon To Stricter Rules,"


Germany’s antitrust watchdog said on Wednesday that U.S. ecommerce giant Amazon’s position is of outstanding, cross-market importance for competition, a classification that allows the authority to prohibit any anti-competitive behaviour at an earlier stage.
The Federal Cartel Office also said it considers Amazon to be dominant in its marketplace services for third-party merchants.
“This means that the classic abuse control, which is applicable in parallel and on the basis of which we are currently already conducting proceedings against Amazon, also applies here,” it said.
Changes to Germany’s antitrust laws for digital corporations, which came into effect last year, give the Cartel Office more power in identifying and prohibiting some companies’ dominant positions.
Amazon said it disagreed with the Cartel Office’s assessment and would carefully review the decision as well as its options, including legal remedies.

Today in the connected economy, Amazon makes a deal with Grubhub that could give it as much as a 15% stake in the food delivery service. Plus, FinTech firm Revolut teams with financial infrastructure platform Stripe to support its expansion plans, while Forever 21 owner Authentic Brands Group (ABG) and checkout technology company Bolt look to expand their partnership after ending their court case.
Amazon could take a 2% to 15% stake in food delivery service Grubhub as part of a deal with parent company Just Eat Takeaway.com that gives Amazon Prime customers a free membership to the service and no-fee delivery from certain restaurants. Just Eat Takeaway will increase Amazon’s ownership stake depending on performance terms focused on adding new Grubhub users.

219,"July 6, 2022",UK Probes Amazon Over Sales Practices,"


The United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is looking into whether Amazon “has a dominant position in the U.K. and whether it is abusing that position and distorting competition by giving an unfair advantage to its own retail business or sellers that use its services,” it announced in a Wednesday (July 6) press release.
The investigation, which will consider whether Amazon is offering preferential treatment to its own third-party sellers on the Amazon U.K. Marketplace, follows the European Commission’s examination of similar concerns for the world’s largest retailer.
Some Amazon Marketplace products are provided through Amazon’s own retail business, but “a large proportion are supplied by third-party sellers,” the release stated. “Amazon provides services to these sellers, including those that are essential to make sales, such as matching sellers with consumers,” and “offers optional services that incur additional fees,” such as the Fulfilment by Amazon service, covering some aspects of the sales process, “including storage, packaging and delivery.”
The CMA investigation will look into how Amazon collects and uses third-party seller data, how Amazon sets criteria for allocation of suppliers to be the preferred/first choice in the Buy Box, and how Amazon sets the eligibility criteria for selling under the Prime label, according to the release.
“Millions of people across the U.K. rely on Amazon’s services for fast delivery of all types of products at the click of a button,” said CMA General Counsel Sarah Cardellin the release. “This is an important area, so it’s right that we carefully investigate whether Amazon is using third-party data to give an unfair boost to its own retail business and whether it favors sellers who use its logistics and delivery services — both of which could weaken competition.”
The CMA also has an open consumer protection investigation into Amazon and Google over concerns they haven’t been doing enough to combat fake reviews on their sites.

220,"March 6, 2022",Austria’s Watchdog Challenges Clearance Of Facebook’s Giphy Deal,"


Austria’s Federal Competition Authority (BWB) has spoken against the purchase operation of Internet image service Giphy by Facebook or its parent company Meta, a move approved by the country’s cartel court. The BWB has appealed to the Austrian Supreme Court (OGH) in hopes of overturning the decision.
At the beginning of February, the deal was approved with conditions by the cartel court, to which the BWB referred the case in August because of its competition concerns, reported DigLogs.
Following the BWB’s appeal, which was backed by the Federal Cartel Prosecutor, the approval of the deal subject to conditions or remedies is not yet legally binding, as the BWB explained on Friday. The cartel court held that any anti-competitive effects were being balanced by the pre-conditions imposed, and it could see no horizontal competition concerns from this merger.

As early as August 2021 the BWB feared that Meta would restrict non-discriminatory access to Giphy for other online services, that it would receive competitively sensitive information about competing online services through Giphy’s library interface, which is integrated into numerous apps, and would “nip in the bud” potential competition with Giphy for advertisers”.
The cartel court largely accepted BWB’s arguments and found that the merger would strengthen Meta’s market position in an anti-competitive manner. According to the cartel court, Meta has a dominant position in the market for social media, owning both Facebook and direct-messaging service WhatsApp. Meta also benefits from relatively high market entry barriers. According to the BWB, the Cartel Court confirmed Meta’s market dominance in the Austrian online advertising market.
The court also accepted the argument that the merger would put Meta’s competitors at risk of losing their access to Giphy’s services or of receiving them in poor quality.

221,"March 2, 2022",9th Cir. Dismisses Developer Class Action Against Facebook,"


An appellate panel partly dismissed an April 2021 ruling in the suit brought by mobile application developers Reveal Chat Hold, Beehive Biometric and USA Technology and Management Services, while also upholding a portion of the decision, reported LawStreet Media.
The non-precedential opinion concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue their injunctive relief claims under the federal antitrust laws and that their claims for damages were time-barred. The class action initiated by the developers had argued for relief from violations of the Sherman and Clayton Acts and various state laws.
The January 2020 suit against Facebook stems from allegations that it acted as a gatekeeper in the social data and social advertising markets. According to the plaintiffs’ complaint and in 2015, Facebook cut off third-party developers from its application programming interfaces (APIs) that the plaintiffs, including Reveal Chat, an anonymous chatting app that was formerly linked to the dating site LikeBright, relied on for their mobile applications.
The complaint also took aim at Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that they further entrenched its monopoly. The plaintiffs contended that their claims were safe from time-sensitivity rules because Facebook engaged in fraudulent concealment to cover its tracks, with plaintiffs only able to discover the alleged conduct after the statute of limitations had run out. 
“Facebook’s March 2019 announcement about the ongoing back-end integration of Instagram and WhatsApp constitutes a new act that is not a reaffirmation of a previous act and inflicts a new and accumulating injury,” one plaintiff explained.
In this week’s six-page opinion, the Ninth Circuit raised the issue of antitrust standing on its own and reviewed the district court’s decision regarding timeliness.
The court said that the plaintiffs’ injunctive relief claims fail because they alleged injuries that occurred in 2015 and were therefore “not fairly traceable to Meta’s challenged conduct in 2019.” The court further reasoned that the plaintiffs neither offered evidence suggesting that Meta’s 2019 actions threatened future harm, nor alleged facts demonstrating that any of the harms they claimed were redressible by the injunctive relief sought.

Meta’s Facebook has expanded its trial team in Washington, DC, federal court, adding a pair of lawyers from Davis Polk & Wardwell as the social media company prepares to fight the US Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust claims, reported Reuters.
Davis Polk partner James Rouhandeh in New York, who leads the firm’s litigation practice, and Michael Scheinkman, also a partner, filed appearance notices late Thursday in the FTC’s case in US District Court for the District of Columbia.
Rouhandeh did not immediately return a message seeking comment. The Davis Polk attorneys will team up with Facebook defense lawyers at Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, including partner Mark Hansen, who did not immediately return a message seeking comment.
Rouhandeh has made appearances for Facebook in other cases and also represented major banks, retail companies and pharmaceuticals in securities litigation. In 2015 he successfully defended the lead underwriters of Facebook’s 2012 initial public offering in a lawsuit seeking more than $100 million in disgorgement.

224,"February 9, 2022","Facebook Hit Hard By New Rules, Google Spared","


Facebook’s owner is alleging Google, which also sells personalized ads on iPhones, has an unfair advantage under Apple’s new policies, reported Bloomberg.
Apps including Facebook have to ask users if they consent to being tracked, but Google’s search results and browser don’t — causing some advertisers’ budgets to shift to Google for more effective targeting.
Meta only started critiquing other tech giants by name in recent years. The social media behemoth, now facing antitrust scrutiny around the world, stands to benefit from framing itself as an underdog, threatened by larger forces.
Still, Meta told investors it expected to miss out on $10 billion in ad revenue in 2022 because of Apple’s changes, making it clear the company is more severely impacted than others. Facebook had relied on data from other apps and websites to make its ads effective. Without it, advertisers need to spend more money to achieve the same results.
Facebook ads are “still important, just costing a heck of a lot more,” said Doug Zarkin, chief marketing officer of Pearle Vision, which relies on Facebook and Instagram to drive people to its eye-care website and stores. He estimated that campaigns are 15% to 30% more expensive than last year.
Last year, Google said it wouldn’t prompt consumers about data collection because, after Apple’s change, it decided not to use any of the data on iPhones that would require permission.
According to Bloomberg, Google also doesn’t need the kind of data Facebook does from third parties in order to make its ads work. It runs its own mobile operating system, Android, and its own ad exchanges.
“Google just happens to be in the right place at the right time,” said Rick Watson, chief executive of RMW Consulting. “They were the biggest recipient of the ad dollars that were shifted because of effectiveness.”

An antitrust court in Austria approved with conditions Facebook’s purchase of animated images platform Giphy, reported Reuters.
Facebook bought Giphy, a website for making and sharing GIFs, a type of animated image used often in social media and instant messaging, for $315 million in 2020 to integrate the operation with its Instagram photo-sharing app.
Related: UK Watchdog Orders Facebook To Sell Giphy Over Competition Concerns
Facebook, whose parent company recently rebranded as Meta Platforms, is challenging a ruling by Britain’s competition watchdog, which said it must sell Giphy because the deal would reduce competition between social media platforms and in display advertising.
Facebook said the Austrian ruling was the first time a court had reviewed the deal. The transaction is too small to be examined at a European Union level.
“The court did not prohibit the merger provided certain conditions were met,” the court said in a short statement on its ruling on the case brought by the Federal Competition Authority.
Those conditions included granting competitors access to Giphy’s image library for five years and helping set up “an alternative provider of a GIF library” within seven years.
“We are pleased with (the) Austrian court’s decision, which recognizes that together, Meta and Giphy would improve Giphy’s product for the millions of people, businesses, developers and API (application programming interface) partners, providing more choices for everyone,” a Meta spokesperson said.

226,"February 7, 2022",Meta May Pull Facebook & Instagram In EU Over Data-Sharing Dispute,"


Meta has said it is considering shutting down Facebook and Instagram in Europe if it can’t keep transferring user data back to the US, reported CNBC.
The social media giant issued the warning in its annual report last Thursday. Regulators in Europe are currently drawing up new legislation that will dictate how EU citizens’ user data gets transferred across the Atlantic.
Facebook said: “If a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs (standard contractual clauses) or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United States, we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe.”
The company added this “would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”
“Meta cannot just blackmail the EU into giving up its data protection standards,” European lawmaker Axel Voss said via Twitter, adding that “leaving the EU would be their loss.” Voss has previously written some of the EU’s data protection legislation.
A Meta spokesperson told CNBC on Monday that the company has no desire and no plans to withdraw from Europe, adding it has raised the same concerns in previous filings.
“But the simple reality is that Meta, and many other businesses, organizations and services, rely on data transfers between the EU and the U.S. in order to operate global services,” they said.

227,"February 3, 2022",AOC Says Facebook “Should Be Broken Up”,"


Facebook should be broken up, New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.“They are acting as an advertiser, they are acting as both platform and vendor, they are … a communications platform, which has historically been a well-established domain of antitrust,” she said in the interview.
The congresswoman added that because Meta has so many different assets built into one company, the case can be made for breaking up the company and “why they should be subject to antitrust activity.”
The call to break up Facebook is not new; in 2020, 48 state attorneys general led by New York Attorney General Letitia James filed an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook in a bid to curtail what they described as the company’s “illegal monopoly” over the social media industry.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched its own antitrust suit against Facebook in 2020, calling for the company’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp to be unwound. James said the coalition of attorneys general would coordinate with the FTC on ongoing legal action.
Lawmakers have previously pressed Facebook on its 2012 and 2014 purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp, respectively, which the FTC vetted at the times. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the company’s lawyers have previously defended the company’s purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram.

By: Jarod Bona (The Antitrust Attorney)
The FTC alleges that Facebook has a longstanding monopoly in the market for personal social networking (PSN) services and that it unlawfully maintained that monopoly through (1) acquiring competitors and potential competitors; and (2) preventing apps that Facebook viewed as potential competitive threats from working with Facebook’s platform.
The FTC’s first claim asserts that Facebook monopolized the market through (1), above—acquiring companies (especially Instagram and WhatsApp) instead of competing. The FTC’s second claim includes both (1) and (2), the interoperability allegations, and invokes Section 13(b) of the FTC Act, which allows the agency to seek an injunction against an entity that “is violating” or “is about to violate” the antitrust laws.
The Court permitted the FTC to go forward with both claims, but also concluded that the facts from the interoperability allegations happened too long ago to fit into Section 13(b)’s “is violating” or “is about to violate” temporal requirement.

230,"July 18, 2022","Apple Sued Over Apple Pay, Accused of Antitrust Violations","


Apple was hit with an antitrust lawsuit over Apple Pay, accused of using its market power in the mobile device industry to fend off competition from other payment card issuers.
The class-action complaint was filed Monday in federal court in San Jose, California.
The iPhone maker “exercises its market power in the device markets by requiring that consumers of its mobile devices also acquire its mobile wallet — Apple Pay — and prevents consumers from using competing mobile wallets capable of offering competing tap and pay solutions,” according to the complaint by Affinity Credit Union.
The plaintiff, Iowa’s Affinity Credit Union, said Apple’s anticompetitive conduct forces the more than 4,000 banks and credit unions that use Apple Pay to pay at least $1 billion of excess fees annually for the privilege.
It also said Apple’s conduct minimizes the incentive for the Cupertino, California-based company to make Apple Pay work better and make it more resistant to security breaches.
“Apple’s conduct harms not only issuers, but also consumers and competition as a whole,” the complaint said.

Apple won a bid on Monday in California federal court for an early 2024 jury trial in an App Store antitrust case, as a judge declined to hold up the litigation while a US appeals court weighs a parallel lawsuit challenging the tech company’s policies as anticompetitive.
Lawyers for Apple at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and attorneys for rival app store Cydia at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan were at odds over how quickly to press ahead in the case. Plaintiff SaurikIT, which developed Cydia, alleged in 2020 the iPhone maker was violating competition law in the app distribution and payment processing markets.
Cydia’s attorneys said the litigation would benefit from hearing from the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in the blockbuster antitrust case Epic Games v Apple, which could be argued as soon as October. But US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who oversaw that case and ruled largely last year for Apple, said on Monday she wanted the case to move ahead faster.
“If something happens that changes the landscape, just come back and talk to me. I’m not going to sit here and wait. [Epic’s] case could go all the way to the Supreme Court,” Gonzalez Rogers said. “We’re going to litigate based upon the current state of the law.”

With the European Union strengthening rules for big tech companies in the block starting in 2023, a new report shows that its antitrust regulators want to probe Apple, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and others due to the video licensing policy of the Alliance for Open Media (AOM).

By: Will Hayter (Competition & Markets Authority Blog)
Few people would doubt just how fundamental smartphones are to our lives. They are increasingly the main way we interact with friends and family, access news, play games, buy products and services online – and now pay for them in shops. Love it or loathe it, our phones have become a key gateway for people and UK businesses alike. Moreover, for some of the poorest households in the country they are the only way to get online and a vital lifeline to essential public resources and services.  This makes the fact that the systems upon which these devices rely are almost entirely controlled by just 2 companies – Apple and Google – concerning. Apple and Google are the gatekeepers to everything coming through our phones, creating a digital stranglehold that is only getting stronger over time.
The problems uncovered in our Mobile Ecosystems Market Study
The powerful position Apple and Google have in these markets, and their impact on competition, has been the subject of our year-long study into mobile ecosystems covering operating systems, browsers and apps on our mobile devices. We concluded that it is extremely difficult for rivals such as other browsers or alternative app stores to compete. Tens of thousands of small businesses reliant on these ecosystems, such as app and web developers, are entirely at the whim of the rules and processes set by these 2 companies.

235,"June 30, 2022",Apple Enables Third-Party Payments in South Korea,"


Apple is now allowing third-party payments in South Korea in response to a new law requiring major app stores to allow alternative payment methods, according to multiple reports on Thursday (June 30).
While Apple will still get a commission, it will be 26% instead of the 30% it reaped from direct payments. In its documentation to developers, Apple said all sales will have to be reported monthly and commissions paid accordingly.
South Korea’s Telecommunications Business Act passed last year states that large platform companies can’t force developers to use their in-app payment systems. While Apple and Google were against the legislation, saying it would undermine their privacy protections, the law passed and is being enforced.
Developers for the Korean App Store must create an alternative version of their apps to sidestep Apple’s payment system. The alternate must be approved by Apple. So far, Apple has approved KCP, Inicis, Toss and NICE, Engadget reported. Some features like Ask to Buy and Family Sharing won’t be available, and Apple won’t handle subscription management or refunds.
Apple’s control over in-app payments is being chipped away in the Netherlands as well, with the Dutch competition regulator ordering Apple to allow dating apps to use alternative in-app payment systems, The Verge reported.
The European Union’s planned Digital Markets Act (DMA) also has provisions regarding Apple’s policies and would allow users to install apps from third-party sources, and enable App Store developers to use alternatives to Apple’s payment systems.

236,"June 29, 2022",Apple & Google Hit With Class Actions By Australian Apps,"


Apple and Google Android users in Australia are suing the California-based technology giants, alleging they used their market power to force app developers to use their payment systems, resulting in higher prices for consumers.
Twin legal actions allege Apple and Google have “a substantial degree of power in the markets for the purchase” of apps via the App Store and Google Play Store respectively, and the in-app purchase of content.
The two tech giants allegedly used their market power in the distribution of apps in Australia to force developers to use Apple and Google payment systems for apps and in-app purchases, then charged commissions of 30 per cent, or in some limited cases 15 per cent.
The class actions on behalf of consumers alleged this conduct breached Australian Consumer Law and resulted in higher prices than if competition was allowed in payment methods for apps and in-app purchases.
It is alleged Apple and Google had superior bargaining positions to app developers; took advantage of that position to breach consumer law; required developers to enter into non-negotiable, standard contracts that the tech giants would unilaterally amend; and the conduct was not necessary to protect their business interests.
The lawsuits include estimates that 55 per cent of the 20.6 million smartphones in Australia are iPhones and 45 percent of people use phones with the Android operating system.

237,"June 23, 2022",Apple Fights Big Tech Regulation Over App Payments,"


Apple leaders are worried that an antitrust bill focused on opening the app store market will make iPhones less secure, despite assurances from Congress, according to a Bloomberg report Thursday (June 23).
Congress and some large firms already use Apple-approved tools that let them bypass the App Store and install third-party apps in a practice called side-loading, the report said. Apple maintains that it’s the only company that can promise a fully secure App Store to its customers.
Congress is set to vote next month on antitrust measures, a move Apple continues to fight, maintaining that “outside apps would leave iPhone users vulnerable to malware and scams,” the report said. Antitrust advocates and cybersecurity specialists, though, say Apple is looking to protect its business model more than its customers.
“Security is a giant red herring,” said Bruce Schneier, a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, in the report. “It will scare a lot of people. The goal is to protect the monopoly.”
Apple requires all iPhone mobile app downloads take place within its App Store, where it takes up to a 30% commission on digital sales. App Store developers must submit apps for review by Apple’s team, who ensure compliance with the company’s rules on privacy and security. Developers are barred from offering sexually explicit content, all-in-one cloud gaming services and cryptocurrency mining, among other things.
Last week, JPMorgan analysts said Apple’s music and gaming revenue could reach $8.2 billion by 2025, a 36% increase that would come from a subscriber base of about 180 million people — 70 million in gaming and 110 million in music.
Most of that revenue would come from Apple Music, taking in about $7 billion. The remaining $1.2 billion would come from Apple Arcade, the gaming subscription service launched three years ago.
While Apple does not give a sales breakup for gaming and music services, its overall segment, which includes App Store, Apple TV+, Arcade and Apple Music, reported $19.82 billion in revenue for the March quarter, Reuters said.

Conspicuously missing from the member list for now however is Apple, which analysts expect to become a dominant player in the metaverse race once it introduces a mixed reality headset this year or next. 
Gaming companies Roblox and Niantic also were not included among the forum’s participants, nor were emerging crypto-based metaverse platforms like The Sandbox or Decentraland.
Apple has not yet publicly acknowledged plans for a headset, although it has reportedly given its board a sneak peek of the product, according to Bloomberg. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the new metaverse forum.

239,"June 15, 2022",Qualcomm Wins Appeals $1B EU Antitrust Fine Over Apple Payments,"


Europe’s second-highest court, the General Court, has sided with Qualcomm after it appealed a €997 million (around $1,045 million) fine from European Union regulators over payments made to Apple to use Qualcomm chips, Reuters reports. 
The EU issued the fine in 2018, and said payments Qualcomm had made to Apple between 2011 and 2016 to exclusively use its chips were illegal under EU antitrust rules. 
“This meant that no rival could effectively challenge Qualcomm in this market, no matter how good their products were,” said EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager in a statement accompanying the fine. Qualcomm was accused of shutting rival chipmaker Intel out of the market, by making it too expensive for Apple to switch suppliers.
But in today’s ruling, the European General Court said that “a number of procedural irregularities affected Qualcomm’s rights of defence and invalidated the Commission’s analysis of the conduct alleged against Qualcomm,” Reuters reports. The court also cast doubt on the EU’s competition analysis, noting that “Apple had had no technical alternative to Qualcomm’s LTE chipsets for the majority of its requirements during the period concerned” and that “the Commission failed to take account of all of the relevant factual circumstances.”
EU regulators now have the option of appealing the decision to the EU Court of Justice (CJEU).
When the fine was issued, Vestager said that it should serve as a warning to other tech companies considering using similar practices. The decision represents a major blow to the EU’s attempts to regulate the fast-moving and well-financed tech sector.
The General Court, Europe’s second-highest, annulled the EU finding and faulted the EU competition enforcer over the handling of the case.
“A number of procedural irregularities affected Qualcomm’s rights of defence and invalidate the Commission’s analysis of the conduct alleged against Qualcomm,” judges said.

240,"June 15, 2022","After 26 Years, Microsoft Retires Internet Explorer","


Microsoft stopped supporting the Internet Explorer web browser on Wednesday, indicating the end is near for a 26-year-old brand with baggage that includes an antitrust case, security flaws and lagging performance. Users will instead be pointed to Microsoft’s newer Edge browser.
While Microsoft doesn’t derive revenue directly from browsers, Edge defaults to the company’s Bing search engine, through which the software and hardware maker generates advertising revenue. That category represents about 6% of Microsoft’s total revenue, at nearly $3 billion in the first quarter.
Microsoft won’t offer technical support or security updates to customers as it focuses more on Edge, a browser that’s available on mobile devices, Mac and even Linux, rather than being confined to Windows. Microsoft released Edge as part of Windows 10 in 2015, to exist alongside Internet Explorer as something new and efficient yet similar to what Windows users already knew.
Internet Explorer still has a small group of devotees, though, in part because it remains the only way to reach certain corporate web applications. It won’t be vanishing yet, even though it’s being retired.
“Over the next few months, opening Internet Explorer will progressively redirect users to our new modern browser, Microsoft Edge with IE mode,” Sean Lyndersay, a general manager at the company, wrote in a blog post. “Users will still see the Internet Explorer icon on their devices (such as on the taskbar or in the Start menu) but if they click to open Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge will open instead with easy access to IE mode. Eventually, Internet Explorer will be disabled permanently as part of a future Windows Update, at which point the Internet Explorer icons on their devices will be removed.”
A “Reload in IE mode” button will appear in the Edge toolbar, and the browser will ask people if they’d like to open a page in IE mode next time, Lyndersay wrote.

241,"June 8, 2022","UK Watchdog To Directly Oversee Amazon, Microsoft Cloud Services","


The UK Treasury released a policy paper on Wednesday (June 8) proposing a new regulatory framework that would provide the Bank of England (BoE) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) with new powers to oversee tech firms that provide critical services to the financial industry. 
The government is concerned about the growing dependence of banks on cloud computing, as these services are mostly provided by a handful of players. As of 2020, over 65% of U.K. firms used the same four cloud providers for cloud infrastructure services, according to the Treasury statement. 
If many firms rely on the same third party for material services and this company fails, it could have a systemic impact across the financial system, the paper argues.  
The government doesn’t cite by name which non-financial companies may be “critical” for the industry, but Amazon and Microsoft are two of the companies that may be affected by this regulation. The financial regulators’ current powers are not sufficient to tackle the systemic risks that disruption at a third party providing key services to multiple firms could cause, so the Treasury is proposing new legislation to address this concern. 
First, the Treasury, in consultation with the BoE and the FCA, will designate certain third parties as “critical.” The policy paper doesn’t offer information about the criteria that regulators will use to designate a company as “critical,” only that it will take into account “the number and type of services and the materiality of these services.”
These criteria will be set out in primary legislation, and it is expected that the third parties affected could also make representations to the Treasury about this designation. 
Second, once a company has been designated as “critical,” the financial regulators will be able to make rules relating to the provision of these material services, gather relevant information from critical third parties and take formal action (including enforcement) where needed. More information about these powers is expected via primary legislation, but the Treasury advances that the regulators will be able to enter companies’ premises as part of an investigation, request information and require the production of documents.  
The paper doesn’t include all the potential penalties for the companies if they don’t comply with the regulator’s requests, but as a last resort, the government is considering granting regulators the power to prohibit a critical third party from providing future services or continuing to provide services to firms. 
The government’s next steps are to propose new legislation and publish a discussion paper on this topic shortly after such legislation is introduced. Legislation could be passed within this parliamentary session that started in May as the government included this plan in the Queen’s speech, which usually determines the laws that will be discussed in a parliamentary session.

242,"May 18, 2022",Microsoft Changes Its Cloud Services To Appease EU Watchdog,"


After complaints from rivals,  Microsoft is relaxing business terms for its cloud computing service in an attempt to avoid a full antitrust probe in Brussels, reported The Financial Times.
The new changes follow concerns from rival cloud providers that Microsoft is using anti-competitive practices to draw customers to its Azure cloud computing platform and away from competitors. Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s executive vice-president in charge of competition and digital policy, confirmed last month that Brussels was “actively following up” on a complaint about Microsoft’s cloud service practices. 
Related: Microsoft Responds To Cloud Antitrust Complaints
On Wednesday, Microsoft president Brad Smith said the tech giant was taking steps that were “very broad but not exhaustive” as he sought to address concerns from regulators and competitors.
Smith said the changes being introduced were “grounded in feedback” he had received from multiple cloud providers across Europe. In a blog post, he wrote: “Some of the most compelling feedback for me personally came from a CEO who said that he felt that he ‘was a victim of friendly fire in Microsoft’s competition with Amazon’. It was hard to hear this — but he was right.”
At issue is a set of licensing rule changes that make it more expensive to run Microsoft Windows, Office, Windows Serverand SQL Server on cloud services other than Microsoft Azure. In a report Tuesday, Bloomberg spoke to customers affected by the issue, including one that found switching to Google Cloud would cost an extra $50 million in Windows licenses. It’s unclear exactly how much expense the rule changes add for the typical customer, though.
“While not all of these claims are valid, some of them are, and we’ll absolutely make changes soon to address them,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a statement. “We’re committed to listening to our customers and meeting the needs of European cloud providers.”

243,"May 9, 2022",Microsoft Launches New Cybersecurity Services For US Clients,"
Microsoft’s security business is growing faster than any of its main products, and now the company is adding heft to its offerings with three new services designed to help organizations spot and respond to cybersecurity incidents.
Microsoft is among the leaders in cloud software and infrastructure, which means its technology is already the backbone for many businesses of all sizes. That puts the company in position to not only make security software available to its client base, but also offer consulting-oriented services in a market where demand far exceeds supply.
The investment comes as organizations ramp up their security spending to manage the increased threats of ransomware attacks and network hacks. Last year, Microsoft and other technology companies pledged to help fill about 500,000 cybersecurity jobs in the U.S., and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said annual research and development spending in cybersecurity would jump to $4 billion from $1 billion.
Security already represents a $15 billion annual business for Microsoft, and in 2021 it increased faster than any other significant product or service the company sold.
Vasu Jakkal, a Microsoft corporate vice president focused on security, told CNBC that a big part of Microsoft’s added spending is on people.
“We’re just expanding the scale because of the demands we are seeing,” Jakkal said.
Among the new products being launched is Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting. It will involve Microsoft engineers flagging issues they find in clients’ devices, Office 365 productivity software installations, cloud applications and identity programs, for $3 per person per month. The launch will put Microsoft in more direct competition with pure-play security software companies like CrowdStrike.

“Fortnite is now available to play FOR FREE streaming to web browsers on iPhone, iPad, and Android via Xbox Cloud. No subscription required, no 30% Apple tax” Epic Games Chief Executive Tim Sweeney said in a tweet.
Epic Games said last month it had raised $2 billion from Sony Group and the family owned holding company behind the Lego Group, valuing the “Fortnite” creator at $31.5 billion.

Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest people alive and renowned investor, has given his own insight into Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, stating that he believes the deal will go through. 
Earlier this year, much to the shock of everyone, Microsoft announced it was planning to acquire Activision Blizzard for just shy of $70 billion. If it goes through, it will be the biggest deal in the history of the gaming industry and give Microsoft ownership of massive franchises like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and many, many more. 
Due to the immensity of the deal, there has been some pushback from politicians and investors, leading some to believe the deal could get shot down.
Warren Buffett, however, has bet that deal will be approved. The billionaire investor’s company, Berkshire Hathaway, increased its position in the company from 2% to 9.5%, a position worth about $6 billion. Buffett made it clear that it was his decision to increase the position. 
“It is my purchase, not the manager who bought it some months ago,” said Buffett. “If the deal goes through, we make some money.”

247,"April 14, 2022",South Korean Watchdog Probes Microsoft Takeover Deal,"


South Korea’s antitrust regulator said on Thursday it has started to review the proposed deal by US software giant Microsoft to buy leading game developer Activision Blizzard.
The Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) said it plans to see if the merger of the two US firms could hurt competition in the online game market, reports Yonhap news agency.
In January, Microsoft announced a plan to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion, and it asked the KFTC last week to review its proposed takeover for approval.
The US competition watchdog is also reportedly reviewing Microsoft’s acquisition of Call of Duty (CoD) maker gaming company Activision Blizzard.
Microsoft’s acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard is yet another play by the tech giant to secure its stake in the nascent Metaverse and bring more intellectual property (IP) under the Xbox and Game Pass umbrella.
When the transaction closes, Microsoft will become the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony.
Following on the 2014 acquisitions of Mojang (makers of Minecraft) and 2021 acquisition of ZeniMax Media/Bethesda (makers of Doom, Elder Scrolls, and Fallout), Activision Blizzard brings IP like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush to Microsoft’s portfolio.

248,"April 3, 2022",EU Watchdog Goes After Microsoft Cloud,"


EU antitrust regulators are quizzing Microsoft’s rivals and customers about its cloud business and licensing deals, a questionnaire seen by Reuters showed, in a move that could lead to a formal investigation and renewed scrutiny of the U.S. software company.
The European Commission has fined Microsoft a total 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in the previous decade for breaching EU antitrust rules and for not complying with its order to halt anti-competitive practices.
The company found itself on the EU competition enforcer’s radar again after German software provider NextCloud, France’s OVHcloud and two other companies filed complaints about Microsoft’s cloud practices. The complaint focuses on the way Microsoft licenses its products, such as its Office productivity suite, that may make it more expensive to use cloud services.
“The Commission has information that Microsoft may be using its potentially dominant position in certain software markets to foreclose competition regarding certain cloud computing services,” the questionnaire said.
Regulators asked if the terms in Microsoft’s licensing deals with cloud service providers allow rivals to compete effectively.
They also want to know if companies needed Microsoft’s operating systems and productivity applications to complement their own cloud infrastructure offering in order to compete effectively.
Having been at the center of a historic antitrust case in the 90s, Microsoft has often managed to avoid the close scrutiny levelled at other Big Tech companies, such as Google or Meta (formerly Facebook). However, other recent moves by the company have also been questioned, signalling a tougher stance from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.

249,"April 1, 2022",Will Microsoft Use Activision Blizzard to Freeze Out Rivals?,"
By: Alex Petros (Public Knowledge)
Virtual bullets and explosions dance across the screen, yet I’m far more focused on what’s coming in through my Playstation headset. Two of my best friends live across the country, yet we stay in touch through the team-based online shooter game Overwatch. Bemoaning the substandard play of our competitors (and occasionally other teammates) is interspersed with discussions of our families, professional lives, and significant others. It almost feels as if we are back in the college dorm room where we met a decade ago, instead of three time zones apart.
Our online gatherings, and many others like it, are now in jeopardy. You see, Overwatch is made by Activision Blizzard and the three of us play on Sony’s Playstation console. Microsoft, Sony’s chief gaming rival, has announced it will be acquiring Activision Blizzard for a whopping $68.7 billion. The deal merits rigorous scrutiny by antitrust enforcers.
Defining the Market
“Video games” can be a nebulous market, and strategic companies are more than capable of stretching the market definition to make themselves seem unthreatening to the watchful eye of antitrust scrutiny. For example, mobile games have skyrocketed in popularity and while there is some overlap, few believe a phone to be a viable substitute for a video game console today. A technically demanding game like Overwatch can’t be played competitively on a mobile device. In addition, mobile game controls lack the precision of console controllers and as of now developers exclusively make blockbuster games for consoles, with few exceptions. Mobile games also mostly operate with a different business model — free-to-play, with monetization driven by advertising and subsequent purchases of in-game currency or premium features. Enforcers will need to determine whether mobile games are part of the market or not (they’re probably not).
Video gaming is dominated by three companies (Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft) across four platforms (Sony’s Playstation 5, Nintendo’s Switch, and Microsoft’s Xbox consoles and PCs). Today’s consoles are more than just some fancy computer hardware and a disc drive. They come with apps, a virtual storefront, and premium services enabling online play and cloud-based gaming. These combine to form an entire ecosystem with multiple ways to monetize consumers.
Of the three major companies, Nintendo is an aberrant player. The Switch lacks the processing power of the other consoles and is focused on exclusive games (Zelda, Mario, etc.) and other metrics like mobility that Sony and Microsoft mostly eschew…

This week the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a ruling in favor of Google in an antitrust case brought by a would-be competitor in the online advertising market. 
The panel rejected the lower court’s September 2021 finding that Inform Inc.’s amended complaint was a “shotgun” pleading and that the company lacked standing to bring the suit, while remanding on the issue of sufficiency as to its seven antitrust causes of action.
The 18-page opinion recounted that Inform is a “digital media advertising company” that “manages the distribution and delivery of video advertisements from content creators into articles on newspaper, magazine, radio, and television websites.” At its peak, Inform reportedly managed ad space for approximately 5,000 publishers.
On This Topic: Data Privacy in Adtech: Boon or Bust?
U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee threw outInform’s amended complaint last year, determining that the lawsuit included“numerous conclusory, vague and immaterial facts not obviously connected to any particular cause of action.”
Inform claims that Google uses its dominance in overlapping markets to “wipe out competition and drive its online ad sales.”
At the heart of the complaint were decisions Google and YouTube made in 2015 to switch the software used to play videos on websites from proprietary digital software developed by Adobe, Flash, to HTML5. Despite the latter being open-source, the change allegedly handed Google more control over “how, when, and what videos are played.”

Former US President Donald Trump’s social media platform Truth Social has not yet been approved for distribution on Alphabet’s Google Play Store due to insufficient content moderation, according to a Google spokesperson.
The delay marks a setback for the app, which launched in the Apple App Store on Feb. 21. Android phones comprise about 40% of the U.S. smartphone market. Without the Google and Apple stores, there is no easy way for most smartphone users to download Truth Social.
“On August 19, we notified Truth Social of several violations of standard policies in their current app submission and reiterated that having effective systems for moderating user-generated content is a condition of our terms of service for any app to go live on Google Play,” Google said in a statement.
Google said it has expressed concerns to Truth Social about violations of its Play Store policies prohibiting content like physical threats and incitement to violence.
Truth Social parent company Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment, but in a press release said that it has “continuously worked in good faith with Google to ensure that the Truth Social Android App complies with Google’s policies without compromising our promise to be a haven for free speech.”
It added: “Moreover, some of our competitors’ apps are allowed in the Google Play Store despite rampantly violating Google’s prohibition on sexual content and other policies, whereas Truth Social has zero tolerance for sexually explicit content.”

253,"August 17, 2022",Australia’s High Court Rules Google Isn’t A Publisher,"
Australia’s highest court overturned on Wednesday a ruling that had found Google engaged in defamation by supplying a link to a contested newspaper article, throwing the spotlight again on how online libel cases are handled in the country.
The seven-judge panel of the High Court of Australia voted 5-2 to throw out an earlier finding that the Alphabet unit played a part in publishing the disputed article by acting as a “library” housing it, saying the website had no active role.
The decision brings fresh confusion to a question that has been simmering in Australia for years about where liability rests for online defamation. A years-long review of the country’s libel law is yet to give a final recommendation on whether large platforms like Google and Meta Platforms’ Facebook should be accountable.
The case stems from a 2004 article which suggested that a criminal defence lawyer had crossed professional lines and become a “confidant” of criminals, according to the published judgment. The lawyer, George Defteros, found a link to the story in a 2016 Google search of his name and had Google remove it after it was viewed by 150 people, the judgment said.
Defteros sued in a state court which found Google was a publisher and ordered it to pay him A$40,000 ($28,056). Google appealed the judgment, culminating in Wednesday’s decision.
“The Underworld article was not written by any employee or agent of the appellant,” two of the panel judges wrote in Wednesday’s ruling, the appellant being Google.
“It was written by a reporter with no connection to the appellant, and published by an independent newspaper over which the appellant had no control or influence.”

Google has failed to take down scam ads that violate its policies, according to Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., chair of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection.
In a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, first reported by The Washington Post on Tuesday, Blumenthal wrote that Google’s policies about deceptive ads “often appear to be dead letter law” because of its lack of enforcement.
“I am deeply concerned that Google appears unwilling to protect consumers and small businesses on Google Ads, and has demonstrated inadequate due diligence against fraud and abuse,” he wrote.
Blumenthal’s letter cites a 2021 article from The Markup that found Google ran ads made to look like government websites in violation of its own policies. At the time, a Google spokesperson told the publication it removed the violating ads.
But Blumenthal said his office recently found deceptive ads using the same keywords mentioned in the article. His staff also found ads for misleading health treatments, he added.
Google has in the past added verification processes meant to limit impersonation of government services, like getting a passport.
But Blumenthal charged that the continued existence of deceptive ads burdens small businesses by making it harder and more expensive for their sites to surface in search results, while padding Google’s pockets.

Google again postponed deprecation of the third-party tracking cookie, this time until the second half of 2024. While Apple blocked third-party cookies several years ago, Google has postponed the process for the Chrome browser numerous times as it works with digital advertisers and technology vendors to agree on a replacement for anonymized audience tracking it calls the Privacy Sandbox.
Google is likely to be sued by the US Department of Justice in September on the grounds that its advertising network is a monopoly. What that means for marketers isn’t yet clear, but there are steps they can take to prepare for disruptions.
EU antitrust authorities have kept watch on how Google handles third-party cookie deprecation and display advertising practices for more than a year, voicing concerns that Google’s ad network may control too much of the European market.
Google’s cookie delays and the impending DoJ antitrust suit likely are unconnected, even though they happened close together, said Liz Miller, Constellation Research analyst. Google is caught in a riptide between two factions of government regulators: Those who want to protect consumer privacy, and those who want to level the playing field for small and midsize businesses that have been priced out of search engine exposure.

Google’s proposed acquisition of cybersecurity consulting service Mandiant will not be opposed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).
ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said: “Our investigation concluded that Google and Mandiant are not competitors in the supply of cybersecurity products and that this acquisition was not likely to substantially lessen competition.
“Our investigation found that there are a number of alternative suppliers of cybersecurity and cloud platform products.

In reaching this view, the ACCC consulted with customers and competitors of Google and Mandiant.
Google announced its intention to acquire all of the issued shares in Mandiant, Inc. on March 7, 2022. The tech company is known for supplying software and internet-based products globally and in Australia.
Meanwhile, Mandiant provides cybersecurity consulting services and other internet security products such as software and managed services globally and in Australia. Both companies are listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange.

Google may soon be facing its second antitrust lawsuit filed by the US Department of Justice. According to Bloomberg, the DOJ is gearing up to sue the tech giant as soon as September after a year of looking into whether it’s been using its dominant position to illegally control the digital ad market. 
The Justice Department’s lawyers have reportedly been conducting another round of interviews to glean additional information that could help make their case stronger. These new interviews are expected to build on previous ones conducted much earlier on in the investigation. 
The Justice Department first filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company back in 2020, accusing it of having an unfair monopoly over search and search-related advertising. For that particular case, the agency argued that forcing Android phone manufacturers to set Google as the default search engine prevents rivals from gaining traction and ensures that the company will earn an enormous amount of money from search-related advertising. 
Some Background: DOJ Preparing Google Ad Technology Suit
The lawsuit against the search giant could reportedly be filed in either Washington, DC or New York, where Google is already battling an antitrust suit focused on the ad market from a coalition of state attorneys general led by Texas.

EU antitrust regulators have asked app developers whether Alphabet unit Google’s threat to remove apps from its Play Store if they use other payment options instead of its own billing system has hurt their business, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Critics say fees charged by Google and Apple at their mobile app stores are excessive and cost developers collectively billions of dollars a year, a sign of the two companies’ monopoly power.

260,"June 19, 2022","Amazon Looks To End EC Probe With Data Sharing, Rival Boosting","


Amazon will share marketplace data with its sellers and boost rivals’ product visibility on its platform if the European Commission will close its 2020 investigation with no fine levied against the world’s largest retailer by the end of this year, people familiar with the situation told Reuters Monday (June 13). 
The company is proposing to allow sellers access to some marketplace data, adding its commercial arm will not be able to use seller data collected by its retail unit. Amazon will also create a second buy box for rival products if an Amazon product appears in the first buy box, the report said. 
Amazon’s process for choosing which retailer appears in the site’s buy box and which generates the bulk of its sales have also been scrutinized.
The company is proposing to allow sellers access to some marketplace data, adding its commercial arm will not be able to use seller data collected by its retail unit. Amazon will also create a second buy box for rival products if an Amazon product appears in the first buy box, the report said.
The commission will likely get feedback from rivals and users in the next several weeks, then possibly tweak its proposal before making a final decision by the end of this year.
Last week, the UK Treasury released a policy paper proposing a new regulatory framework that would provide the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority with new powers to oversee tech firms that provide critical services to the financial industry.
The government is concerned about the growing dependence of banks on cloud computing, as these services are mostly provided by a handful of players. As of 2020, over 65% of U.K. firms used the same four cloud providers for cloud infrastructure services, according to the Treasury statement.

261,"June 13, 2022",Amazon Opens Space Rivals To Avert Any EU Antitrust Fine,"


Amazon has offered to share marketplace data with sellers and boost the visibility of rival products on its platform, trying to persuade EU antitrust regulators to close their investigations without a fine by the end of the year, people familiar with the matter said.
The world’s largest online retailer is hoping its concessions will stave off a potential European Union fine that could be as much as 10% of its global turnover, Reuters reported last year.
The European Commission in 2020 charged Amazon with using its size, power and data to push its own products and gain an unfair advantage over rival merchants that sell on its online platform.
It also launched an investigation into Amazon’s possible preferential treatment of its own retail offers and those of marketplace sellers that use its logistics and delivery services.
Amazon’s process for choosing which retailer appears in the “buy box” on its website and which generates the bulk of its sales also came under the spotlight.

262,"June 12, 2022",Amazon India Seller Says Antitrust Raid Detained Employees,"


A former top seller for Amazon in India, Cloudtail, has accused India’s antitrust agency of illegally detaining its employees during a raid over suspected competition law violations, court documents seen by Reuters show.
Cloudtail, among a handful of online sellers raided in an investigation of Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart over suspected preferential treatment on e-commerce platforms, argued in a court filing the detentions were cause for disallowing materials taken during the raid. 
“[Three] employees from the senior management were detained for over 30 hours through the night till the completion of the search & seizure operation,” the May 30 filing said. The operation was conducted on April 28 and 29.
A senior source at the Competition Commission of India (CCI), which conducted the raid, rejected the allegations, saying it had obtained the requisite legal approvals and was in line with the watchdog’s regulatory processes. The source was not authorised to speak to the media and declined to be identified.

263,"June 8, 2022","UK Watchdog To Directly Oversee Amazon, Microsoft Cloud Services","


The UK Treasury released a policy paper on Wednesday (June 8) proposing a new regulatory framework that would provide the Bank of England (BoE) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) with new powers to oversee tech firms that provide critical services to the financial industry. 
The government is concerned about the growing dependence of banks on cloud computing, as these services are mostly provided by a handful of players. As of 2020, over 65% of U.K. firms used the same four cloud providers for cloud infrastructure services, according to the Treasury statement. 
If many firms rely on the same third party for material services and this company fails, it could have a systemic impact across the financial system, the paper argues.  
The government doesn’t cite by name which non-financial companies may be “critical” for the industry, but Amazon and Microsoft are two of the companies that may be affected by this regulation. The financial regulators’ current powers are not sufficient to tackle the systemic risks that disruption at a third party providing key services to multiple firms could cause, so the Treasury is proposing new legislation to address this concern. 
First, the Treasury, in consultation with the BoE and the FCA, will designate certain third parties as “critical.” The policy paper doesn’t offer information about the criteria that regulators will use to designate a company as “critical,” only that it will take into account “the number and type of services and the materiality of these services.”
These criteria will be set out in primary legislation, and it is expected that the third parties affected could also make representations to the Treasury about this designation. 
Second, once a company has been designated as “critical,” the financial regulators will be able to make rules relating to the provision of these material services, gather relevant information from critical third parties and take formal action (including enforcement) where needed. More information about these powers is expected via primary legislation, but the Treasury advances that the regulators will be able to enter companies’ premises as part of an investigation, request information and require the production of documents.  
The paper doesn’t include all the potential penalties for the companies if they don’t comply with the regulator’s requests, but as a last resort, the government is considering granting regulators the power to prohibit a critical third party from providing future services or continuing to provide services to firms. 
The government’s next steps are to propose new legislation and publish a discussion paper on this topic shortly after such legislation is introduced. Legislation could be passed within this parliamentary session that started in May as the government included this plan in the Queen’s speech, which usually determines the laws that will be discussed in a parliamentary session.

264,"June 6, 2022",Amazon Exec Tried Lobbying Third-Party Sellers For Support Against Big Tech Bill,"


An Amazon vice president took to a popular forum used by third-party merchants to encourage them to reject landmark legislation targeting the power of US tech giants.
But the effort appeared to backfire, as many sellers disputed Amazon’s argument and said they intend to support the legislation, which seeks to overhaul US antitrust laws and reel in the power of Big Tech.
Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon’s vice president of worldwide selling partner services, published the post on Thursday in Amazon’s Seller Central Forum. He encouraged merchants to contact their local senator to oppose the legislation, called the American Innovation and Choice Online Act (S.2992), which was passed by a Senate committee in January and could move forward this summer.
“As we have noted in previous communications to you throughout the past year, Congress is considering legislation, including S.2992, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, that could jeopardize Amazon’s ability to operate a marketplace service and, as a result, your business’s ability to sell in our store,” Mehta wrote. “Recent public comments from Senate leadership indicate that they intend to vote on S.2992 later this month. I want to ensure that you are aware of this legislation and what you can do to try and stop it from harming you.”
Related: Bernie Sanders Goes After Amazon Chairman At Senate Hearing
Mehta then directed Amazon sellers to a website that includes a form they can use to contact their senator. The page is populated with a prewritten email opposing the legislation, and says filling out the form “will take less than two minutes of your time.”
Hundreds of sellers replied to Mehta’s post, including many who seemed unconvinced by Amazon’s point of view and promised to support the legislation. Third-party sellers, who account for more than half of Amazon’s retail volume, have in recent years expressed frustration over the costs they pay to stay in good standing, the amount Amazon charges them for ads and Amazon’s inability to rid the marketplace of scams and bad actors.
“Yes, I’m going to oppose the idea that Amazon will be prohibited from undercutting, manipulating the buybox, and instituting restrictions on certain listings that unfairly bar me from selling an item,” one commenter wrote. “Yup, writing to my senator right now.”
Another wrote that, “Any informed seller is going to support massive action taken against Amazon in the antitrust arena. I am personally sick of the condescending posts by Amazon management directed at us. We are not morons and know how to read and think for ourselves.”

265,"June 1, 2022",Amazon Takes Aim At New Antitrust Bill,"


Amazon has sharply criticized a looming antitrust bill in Congress that it says unfairly targets the company and could degrade its customers’ experience, reported Reuters. Amazon is saying the bill unfairly singles the retailer out while not subjecting rivals to similar regulations.
On Wednesday Amazon said in a blog post that the bill “jeopardizes two of the things American consumers love most about Amazon: the vast selection and low prices made possible by opening our store to third-party selling partners, and the promise of fast, free shipping through Amazon Prime.”
It argued the bill only targets one retailer, Amazon, by requiring a market value of at least $550 billion to qualify for regulation and that rivals like Walmart, Target and CVS were excluded.
“In 2021, Walmart had annual revenues of $559 billion, nearly $90 billion more than Amazon,” it added. “But Walmart is excluded despite also being a large retailer that allows small businesses to sell in its online marketplace.”
Media outlets have said the Senate could vote on the bill as early as this month. The measure passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, despite hefty lobbying from top executives like Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook. It also passed the House Judiciary Committee last year.
Senators Amy Klobuchar and Chuck Grassley, who co-sponsored the measure called the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, say the measure is necessary to protect small businesses. The bill has received the backing of small business groups such as the Main Street Alliance and Small Business Rising.
Amazon argued the bill could harm the hundreds of thousands of small businesses that sell goods on its website as its large fines for violations “would make it difficult to justify the risk of Amazon offering a marketplace in which selling partners can participate.”
It said the bill would mandate “Amazon allow other logistics providers to fulfill Prime orders” and could make it “potentially impossible in practice, for Amazon and our selling partners to offer products with Prime’s” free two-day shipping.
Big tech firms including Facebook and Apple, have been under pressure in Congress amid allegations they have abused their outsized market power. A long list of bills have been proposed to rein them in, but none have become law.

266,"May 18, 2022",Amazon Files Second Motion To Dismiss Third-Party Seller Pricing Suit,"


Amazon has filed a second motion to dismiss a Western District of Washington case that alleges its third-party seller policies are anticompetitive insofar as they create an artificial price floor for goods sold simultaneously on its platform and other online outlets. Monday’s motion, primarily targeting the plaintiffs’ standing, comes as Amazon’s motion for reconsideration of the court’s March dismissal order pends.
The 2020 suit alleges that Amazon’s policies prevent price competition for goods sold across platforms like eBay or Walmart.com by restraining sellers from offering lower prices for their goods on sites other than Amazon. Reportedly, Amazon enforces the policy by monitoring prices and threatening to punish sellers who fail to conform.
The complaint states antitrust causes of action on behalf of a proposed class of anyone who purchased one or more of an estimated 340 million supra competitively priced consumer products offered for sale by an Amazon third-party seller and purchased through a retail e-commerce channel other than Amazon Marketplace.In the court’s March ruling on Amazon’s motion to dismiss the plaintiff’s first amended complaint, it found in relevant part that the plaintiffs have antitrust standing to pursue their claims as direct purchasers in conjunction with the theory that third-party sellers are co-conspirators, even if unwittingly so.
Amazon moved for reconsideration of the decision, arguing that it suffered multiple flaws. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, and now, Amazon seeks not to “reargue points the Court decided,” but to dismiss on the basis that the plaintiffs lack standing for their antitrust claims on previously undecided bases.

267,"May 16, 2022",Biden Administration And Amazon’s Bezos Face Off Over Inflation,"


White House and Amazon’s founder Jeff Bezos squared off on Monday May 16 over the Biden administration’s handling of US inflation and its plans to increase taxes for the rich, reported Forbes. 
Over the weekend Bezos had been heavily criticizing the steps proposed by President Joe Biden, accusing him of misleading the public on inflation by arguing that hiking taxes on corporations and the rich would lower consumer costs. 
“It doesn’t require a huge leap to figure out why one of the wealthiest individuals on Earth opposes an economic agenda for the middle class that cuts some of the biggest costs families face, fights inflation for the long haul, and adds to the historic deficit reduction the President is achieving by asking the richest taxpayers and corporations to pay their fair share,” deputy White House press secretary Andrew Bates said in a statement. 
“It’s also unsurprising that this tweet comes after the President met with labor organizers, including Amazon employees,” Bates added. 
Bezos responded a short time later on Twitter, accusing the White House of trying to “muddy the topic” and shift the focus away from soaring inflation. 
“They know inflation hurts the neediest the most. But unions aren’t causing inflation and neither are wealthy people. Remember the Administration tried their best to add another $3.5 TRILLION to federal spending,” Bezos tweeted. “They failed, but if they had succeeded, inflation would be even higher than it is today, and inflation today is at a 40 year high.”
The back-and-forth escalated the war of words between the White House and one of the world’s richest men after Biden attacked Amazon for paying too little in federal taxes and appeared to side with workers seeking to unionize some of the company’s employees.

US Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders on Thursday slammed Amazon and its chairman at a hearing on the company’s labor practices as he pushed the White House to end government contracts for the retailer.
“Amazon has done everything possible – legal and illegal – to defeat union organizing efforts,” Sanders said.
But the company won bipartisan support at the hearing, including from Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, a state with a large Amazon presence.
“I don’t think Amazon is an organized criminal syndicate,” Kaine said, adding he backs efforts to make it easier for workers to unionize. “Amazon employs a million Americans – not everybody hates their jobs at Amazon.”
Sanders addressed Amazon Chairman Jeff Bezos, who had been invited to testify but did not appear.
“Given all your wealth, how much do you need? Why are you doing everything in your power, including breaking the law, to deny Amazon workers the right to join a union so that they can negotiate for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits?” Sanders asked. “How much do you need?”

Facebook must face antitrust litigation over its alleged advertising pact with Google and its alleged strategy of building a social media empire by deceiving users about its data privacy practices, a federal judge in California ruled.
Judge Lucy H. Koh let proposed class actions advance against Facebook on behalf of consumers and advertisers, citing “more than plausible” allegations that the tech giant used lies and deceptive statements about data privacy to gain a dominant competitive edge over rival platforms that told the truth.

Facebook has also been fighting an antitrust lawsuit by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC lawsuit will be allowed to continue with its allegations of monopolization, rejecting Facebook’s dismissal requests.
The complaint also alleges Google manipulated its ad pricing tiers under a secret program called Project Bernanke that removed second-place bids on ad auctions. It allowed Google to pocket part of the difference between first and third-place bids while also harming publishers that rely on ad revenue and who could have made more from higher bids.
Under the agreement with Facebook, Google and Facebook illegally collaborated to decrease prices paid to publishers, cut out rival ad networks, and manipulate ad auctions operated by publishers, the complaint states.

272,"January 17, 2022",UK Suit Claims Facebook Exploited Personal User Data,"


Facebook, now known as Meta, faces a fine of over $3.2 billion over allegations that it exploited data and abused its market dominance, Reuters reported Friday (Jan. 14), reported PYMNTS.
A senior adviser to the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, Liza Lovdahl Gormsen, said she was bringing the class action case on behalf of Facebook users in Britain that used the platform between 2015 and 2019.
Per the report, Facebook allegedly earned billions of pounds through its unfair terms and conditions, which made users give up valuable personal data to access the popular social media network.
In response to the lawsuit, Facebook said that those who used its services did so because it was valuable for them, and “they have meaningful control of what information they share on Meta’s platforms and who with.”
Gormsen said there was a “dark side” to Facebook in that it reportedly abused its market dominance and put these unfair terms and conditions on users by collecting data through things like Facebook Pixel. This reportedly allowed it to build an “all-seeing picture” of internet usage, generating detailed profiles of users.
Facebook has also been fighting an antitrust lawsuit by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. PYMNTS reported that the FTC lawsuit will be allowed to continue with its allegations of monopolization, rejecting Facebook’s dismissal requests.

Nearly four dozen states on Friday, January 14, asked a federal appeals court to reconsider an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook that a judge threw out last year, reported CNBC.
The states, led by New York AG Letitia James, argued the judge wrongly dismissed their case, which alleged Facebook, now known as Meta, illegally maintained monopoly power and made unlawful acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp to foreclose competition.
In June, US District Court Judge James Boasberg wrote that the long period of time the states waited to challenge the acquisitions was unprecedented on the state level and said its claims about Facebook’s attempt to amass power through its data policies were not illegal under antitrust law.
Related: FTC & 46 States Hit Facebook With Antitrust Suit
The states argue in their appeal that the court’s determination of an unreasonable delay in filing its case “does not apply against sovereign States suing to protect the public interest, like the States here.” They also wrote that the judge erred in determining Facebook’s data policies could not violate antitrust law.
Additionally, the states argued the district court judge wrongly presumed Facebook stopped the alleged unlawful behavior on its platform by 2018 and that injunctive relief should not be available in that case. But the states argued unlawful conduct continued and that the relief remains available even after the conduct stops.

274,"January 14, 2022",NY AG & States Look To End Facebook’s “Illegal Monopoly”,"


New York Attorney General Letitia James today led a bipartisan coalition of 48 attorneys general from around the nation in continuing to fight to end Facebook’s illegal efforts to stifle competition and protect its monopoly power. 
The coalition filed an appeal brief arguing that the district court’s ruling dismissing the states’ case was in error. Attorney General James and the coalition argue that the court was wrong to dismiss their case as time-barred, and made additional legal and factual errors. Over the last decade, Facebook, now known as Meta, illegally acquired competitors in a predatory manner and cut or conditioned services to smaller threats — depriving users of the benefits of competition and reducing privacy protections and services along the way — all in an effort to boost its bottom line through increased advertising revenue.
“Mark Zuckerberg claims to be building the metaverse, but the actions of Facebook continue to cause significant harm to millions of consumers and many small businesses here in the real world,” said Attorney General James. “Time and again, the social media giant has used its market dominance to force small companies out of business and reduce competition for millions of users. We’re filing this appeal with the support of almost every state in the nation because we will always fight efforts to stifle competition, reduce innovation, and cut privacy protections, even when we face a goliath like Facebook.”In December 2020, Attorney General James and the coalition filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to stop Facebook’s anticompetitive conduct. The company filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted by the court last summer. Today’s appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit asks the court to allow the coalition of attorneys general to move forward with their suit.
Separately, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also filed an amended complaint against Facebook in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. In a ruling earlier this week, the court denied Facebook’s motion to dismiss the FTC’s complaint, allowing the FTC to proceed.Attorney General James leads the appeal with an executive committee comprised of the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, and the District of Columbia. The executive committee is joined by the attorneys general of Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and the territory of Guam.

US District Judge James Boasberg granted Facebook’s earlier motion to dismiss over the summer, but allowed the FTC a chance to amend its complaint and try again, per Reuters. He also dismissed a similar lawsuit from a coalition of state attorneys general without granting a chance for reconsideration, though the states have indicated they intend to appeal that ruling.
“The Federal Trade Commission’s first antitrust suit against Facebook, Inc. stumbled out of the starting blocks, as this Court dismissed the Complaint last June,” Boasberg wrote in Tuesday’s filing. He said while the Commission’s core theory remains the same in its updated complaint, “The facts alleged this time around to fortify those theories, however, are far more robust and detailed than before, particularly in regard to the contours of Defendant’s alleged monopoly.”

Boasberg initially dismissed the FTC’s complaint because he said it failed to plausibly allege Facebook’s monopoly power in what it defined as the personal social networking services market.

278,"January 6, 2022",France Hits Google & Facebook With Fine Over Cookies,"


According to Reuters, France’s data privacy watchdog CNIL has fined Alphabet’s Google a record 150 million euros ($169 million) for making it difficult for internet users to refuse online trackers known as cookies.
Facebook was also fined 60 million euros for the same reason, the CNIL said.
Internet users’ prior consent for the use of cookies — tiny snippets of data that help build targeted digital ad campaigns — is a key pillar of the European Union’s data privacy regulation and a top priority for the CNIL.
“When you accept cookies, it’s done in just one click,” said Karin Kiefer, CNIL’s head for data protection and sanctions. “Rejecting cookies should be as easy as accepting them”.
In its statement, the watchdog said it had found that the facebook.com, google.fr and youtube.com websites didn’t allow the refusal of cookies easily, citing Google’s video-streaming platform.
The CNIL said the two companies had three months to comply with its orders or face an extra penalty payment of 100,000 euros per day of delay.
These include the obligation for Google and Facebook to provide French internet users simpler tools for refusing cookies, in order to guarantee their consent.
The CNIL said that while Google and Facebook provided a virtual button to allow the immediate acceptance of cookies, there was no equivalent to refuse them as easily.
“People trust us to respect their right to privacy and keep them safe. We understand our responsibility to protect that trust and are committing to further changes and active work with the CNIL in light of this decision,” a Google spokesperson said. France Google Facebook Fine
CNIL’s previous record fine in 2020 also targeted Google and amounted to 100 million euros.

280,"June 14, 2022",German Watchdog Goes After Apple Over Privacy,"


Germany’s competition watchdog has launched a probe into Apple’s privacy rules, fearing that the company’s move to clamp down on user-tracking could have anti-competitive effects.
Bundeskartellamt chief Andreas Mundt said Tuesday that Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, which was introduced in April 2021 and establishes preconditions for user-tracking by third-party apps, could be abused to give a leg up to Apple’s own services.
At the heart of the matter are concerns that the US tech giant’s rules obstruct third-party apps from accessing data used for targeted advertising, while not limiting Apple’s ability to obtain that same data.
“A corporation like Apple which is in a position to unilaterally set rules for its ecosystem, in particular for its app store, should make pro-competitive rules,” Mundt said. “We have reason to doubt that this is the case when we see that Apple’s rules apply to third parties, but not to Apple itself.
“This would allow Apple to preference its own offers or impede other companies.” Apple refuted the cartel office’s claims Tuesday and touted the benefits of its privacy-preserving approach.
“ATT does not prevent companies from advertising or restrict their use of the first-party data they obtain from users with their consent,” an Apple spokesperson said. “These rules apply equally to all developers — including Apple — and we have received strong support from regulators and privacy advocates for this feature.”
Germany’s efforts follow scrutiny of Apple’s ATT framework by both the French and Polish competition authorities and are based on new competencies that the Bonn-based regular was given as part of last year’s competition reform for digital markets. An investigation was launched in June last year to determine Apple’s significance for competition across markets as part of the new rules.

281,"June 13, 2022","Apple Complies With Dutch Regulators, Allows Other Payment Methods on Dating Apps","
Apple now plans to allow other methods of payment for Dutch dating apps, after intervention from the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM), a report from ACM said.
This will see a change to the old rules, in which customers of dating apps were only able to pay using payment methods imposed by Apple.
ACM said Apple had abused its dominant position — and now dating-app providers will let customers pay in more varieties of ways.
ACM’s judgment came with an order subject to periodic penalty payments, totaling 50 million euros.
According to Martijn Snoep, chairman of ACM, the intent was to help everyone get the full benefits of the digital economy.
“In the digital economy, powerful companies have a special responsibility to keep the market fair and open,” Snoep said in the report. “Apple avoided that responsibility, and abused its dominant position vis-à-vis dating-app providers. We are glad that Apple has finally brought its conditions in line with European and Dutch competition rules. That offers app providers more opportunities to compete. And consumers will ultimately reap the benefits, too.”
That came after the tech giant also agreed to let the company take alternative payments, scaling back its push for control over all user data.
Google will now not be able to reject or remove Match Group apps from the Play Store for taking other payments.
And the company will take Match Group app updates providing alternatives for Google Play billing, and Google will work on “deficiencies of Google Play billing” to let Match Group apps test Google’s system alongside current pay systems.

Britain’s competition watchdog said it was planning to investigate the market dominance of Apple and Google’s mobile browsers, as well as the iPhone maker’s restrictions on cloud gaming through its app store.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Friday it was also taking enforcement action against Alphabet Inc’s Google over its app store payment practices.
It said the two tech giants had an “effective duopoly” on mobile ecosystems that gave them a stranglehold on operating systems, app stores and web browsers on mobile devices.

283,"June 12, 2022",Dutch Regulator Says Apple Will Allow Payment Options On Dating Apps,"


The Netherlands’ antitrust watchdog on Saturday said Apple will allow different payment methods in Dutch dating applications, ending a dispute that resulted in the company being fined 50 million euros ($52.58 million).
The Authority for Consumers and Markets (AMC) said in a statement that with this concession, Apple will meet the requirement that the regulator had set under the European Union and Dutch competition rules.
The iPhone maker has long mandated use of its in-app payment system, which charges commissions of up 30% that some developers like Tinder owner Match Group  have argued are too high.
“In the digital economy, powerful companies have a special responsibility to keep the market fair and open. Apple avoided that responsibility, and abused its dominant position vis-à-vis dating-app providers,” said Martijn Snoep, chairman of the board of ACM.

284,"June 7, 2022",Apple Must Change Its EU Charging Ports By 2024,"


Apple must change the connector on iPhones sold in Europe by 2024 after EU countries and lawmakers agreed on Tuesday to a single charging port for mobile phones, tablets and cameras in an unprecedented decision that will have wide-reaching consequences for the world’s tech industry.
The political intervention, which the European Commission said would make life easier for consumers and save them money, came after companies failed to reach a common solution.
Brussels has been pushing for a single mobile charging port for more than a decade, prompted by complaints from iPhone and Android users about having to switch to different chargers for their devices.
iPhones are charged from a Lightning cable, while Android-based devices use USB-C connectors. USB-C, part of the ubiquitous and openly sourced USB family of connector formats, is more widely used than Apple’s proprietary Lightning design.
The company, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, had earlier warned that the proposal would hurt innovation and create a mountain of electronics waste. Despite that, its shares were up 0.9% in morning trade in New York.
The move could become a sales driver for Apple in 2024, analysts said, encouraging more Europeans to buy the latest gadgets instead of ones lacking USB-C ports.

285,"May 29, 2022",Apple Must Face Cydia Antitrust Lawsuit,"


A US judge has decided to allow third-party app store Cydia to present its antitrust case against Apple, after dismissing Apple’s claim that the matter at hand has exceeded the statute of limitations.
In January 2022, US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers granted Apple’s motion to dismiss a case brought against it by a jailbreak-focused App Store.
Apple had filed for the dismissal, citing that the complaint was outside the four-year window allowed by federal antitrust law. However, she also granted Cydia’s creator, Jay Freeman, leave to amend his suit.
Alternative app store SaurikIT, also known as Cydia, filed suit in 2020, alleging violations of the Sherman Act and Unfair Competition Law. Cydia said Apple lifted parts of the Cydia store and incorporated them into its App Store in 2008.
On Thursday, Judge Gonzalez Rogers ruled in favor of Freeman’s claim, as noted by Reuters. While she found that the claims of the first lawsuit did fall outside of the statute of limitations, Cydia’s amended lawsuit alleged that updates Apple made in 20118 and 2021 were designed to harm iOS app distributors like Cydia.
“To the extent plaintiff’s claims rely on Apple’s technological updates to exclude Cydia from being able to operate altogether, those claims are timely,” Judge Gonzalez Rogers said in the ruling.
Initially filed in December 2020, Cydia’s lawsuit claimed that Apple used its monopoly position against it.

286,"May 11, 2022",Apple Defends Its Policies In Australia,"
Apple has robustly defended its ecosystem in a submission to Australia’s competition watchdog, amid growing global scrutiny of the power of big tech companies and “gatekeeping.”
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has scrutinized Apple’s ecosystem in a series of investigations since last year and encouraged the company to give users more control over preinstalled apps and services. In a detailed response to the ACCC’s Digital Platform Services Inquiry Discussion Paper, Apple argued that proposed changes to its ecosystem “would reduce incentives for dynamic firms like Apple to innovate and develop new and differentiated products” and expose users to a “far less secure and private environment.”
Apple is puzzled that the competition and consumer protection agency would prioritise purported competition concerns which lack cogent evidence of harm, over clear and present severe damage to users that they experience every day. That is not what consumers want to see as outcomes of legislative reform – they want stronger, not weaker, protection – from the unlawful conduct which affects the hundreds of thousands of Australians every year whose information is stolen, scammed, traded and exploited to their detriment.
Apple highlighted confidential data that it submitted to the ACCC that shows there is “a meaningful, consistent, and upward-trending willingness of users to switch between devices and platforms, and an ongoing capacity for them to do so.” The company also argued that it competes with “other software distribution platforms to attract developers to the App Store,” citing web apps as an example of “an alternative means for developers to distribute apps to iOS users.”
Australia is among the many countries now heavily scrutinizing Apple’s ecosystem and threatening pervasive legislation in an attempt to force changes, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, the European Union, and more, with a clear appetite from global regulators to explore requirements around app store policies, app sideloading, and interoperability.

287,"May 9, 2022",Apple & Google Concerned With ACCC’s Proposal For Antitrust Reforms,"


Apple and Google, and the Australian industry group advocating for tech giants have unsurprisingly raised concerns about the proposed measures that were outlined in the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) discussion paper for the Digital Platforms Services inquiry.
In its discussion paper that was published in February, the country’s competition watchdog put forward a slew of legislative measures that took aim at big tech issues, including anti-competitive conduct, bargaining imbalances, insufficient consumer and business user protections, and more.
In response to those proposals, Apple expressed its discontent, describing in its submission that the proposed reforms would result in Australian consumers being “net worse off” and that it is “puzzled” about why the agency would “prioritise purported competition concerns”, which it believes “lack cogent evidence of harm, over clear and present severe damage to users that they experience every day”.
“That is not what consumers want to see as outcomes of legislative reform — they want stronger, not weaker, protection — from the unlawful conduct which affects the hundreds of thousands of Australians every year whose information is stolen, scammed, traded and exploited to their detriment,” Apple wrote.
The Cupertino company also criticised the ACCC’s reforms as being directed at addressing hypothetical, rather than existing problems, and that the changes would “regrettably” change iPhone and other Apple services, including iOS and the App Store, and result in changes to Apple’s privacy and security standards and leave existing users exposed to less secure and private environments.
“Much of the discussion paper appears to proceed on the assumption that there is a relevant market failure arising from Apple’s purported market power,” Apple said.

288,"May 4, 2022",PayPal Pushed EU Antitrust Complaint About Apple Wallet,"


Apple Pay competitor PayPal played a role in the EU’s decision to target Apple with antitrust complaints about its mobile wallet, reports Bloomberg. 
PayPal was one of “multiple companies” that filed informal complaints about the way Apple restricts third-party apps from accessing the NFC capabilities of the iPhone, which in turn led to the European Commission issuing a Statement of Objections against Apple.
The European Commission believes that Apple is unfairly limiting access to the NFC chip, preventing PayPal, Venmo, banks, and other payment services from offering features that are equivalent to ‌Apple Pay‌, which in turn limits the mobile payment options that ‌iPhone‌ users have access to in stores.No third-party apps are able to access NFC on the ‌iPhone‌, so ‌Apple Pay‌ is the only tap to pay payment method available. Apple claims that the restriction is designed to safeguard user privacy and security, but it will now face an EU investigation.
The European Commission has informed Apple of its preliminary view that it abused its dominant position in markets for mobile wallets on iOS devices. By limiting access to a standard technology used for contactless payments with mobile devices in stores (‘Near-Field Communication (NFC)’ or ‘tap and go’), Apple restricts competition in the mobile wallets market on iOS.
PayPal has an Apple Pay-like tap to pay option that’s available to Android users, and the company wants to be able to offer a similar feature on the ‌iPhone‌. Such a feature would require PayPal to use the NFC chip in the ‌iPhone‌, but it is not able to do so with Apple’s current restrictions.

289,"May 3, 2022",Dutch Regulator Still Unsatisfied With Apple’s Rules,"


In a statement obtained by journalist Nando Kasteleijn, the Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) said that while Apple eliminating its requirement for Dutch dating apps to create a separate app binary in order to accept alternative payments was an improvement, the company has yet to fully comply with Dutch and European regulations. The statement did not outline the specific conditions that Apple has yet to comply with.
The ACM already fined Apple a total of €50 million between January and March for failing to comply with the order, and the competition regulator said it is now preparing a new order with additional penalties that will be published in the coming weeks.
The saga began in December 2021, when the ACM announced that Apple must let dating apps accept alternative payment methods on the App Store in the Netherlands. Apple complied with the demand, but it initially required Dutch dating apps to submit a separate app binary to accept alternative payments. Apple has since made several changes to its rules surrounding Dutch dating apps, but the ACM remains unsatisfied.
Apple previously said that while it disagrees with the order and is appealing the decision, the changes it announced on March 30 demonstrated the company’s ongoing commitment to fulfill its legal obligations in the Netherlands.

290,"March 22, 2022","US Watchdogs Seek More Data From Activision, Microsoft Deal","


The US Federal Trade Commission has sought additional data from Activision Blizzard and Microsoft related to the antitrust review of their deal, the games developer said in a regulatory filing on Monday.
Microsoft in January agreed to acquire the “Call of Duty” maker for $68.7 billion in the biggest gaming industry deal in history. The all-cash deal will bolster Microsoft’s firepower in the booming videogaming market, where it will take on leaders Tencent and Sony.
Microsoft will file for approval of the deal in 17 jurisdictions, the company’s president, Brad Smith, told reporters last month.
In order to woo US. and other regulators, the company said in February that it had developed a new set of principles for its app store, including open access to developers who meet privacy and security standards.
With the Activision deal, Microsoft will take on industry leaders Tencent Holdings and Sony Group. Sony Interactive Entertainment recently said it would buy Bungie Inc, creator of the “Halo” videogame, in a deal valued at $3.6 billion.
The FTC’s challenge of the deal is considered the first test to show its new approach to mergers since the joint consultation with the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division (DOJ) to review the merger guidelines.

291,"March 16, 2022",EU Goes After Microsoft’s Cloud Services,"


French cloud-computing company OVHcloud has filed an antitrust complaint in Europe against Microsoft Corp., adding to recent criticism of the competitive practices at a company that has largely avoided the recent regulatory scrutiny aimed at rival tech giants.
OVHcloud said it filed the complaint with the European Commission, the European Union’s top competition regulator. The complaint focuses on the way Microsoft licenses its products, such as its Office productivity suite, that may make it more expensive to use cloud services.
The complaint, which OVHcloud filed last summer but which hasn’t previously been reported, also alleges that Microsoft’s software doesn’t work as well on other cloud services, making it harder for them to compete, the people said.
“Through abusing its dominant position, Microsoft undermines fair competition and limits consumer choice in the cloud computing services market,” said a spokeswoman for OVHcloud, whose formal name is OVH Groupe SAS.
“Cloud providers enjoy many options to provide cloud services to their customers using Microsoft software, whether purchased by the customer or the partner,” the Microsoft spokesman said in a statement. “We’re continuously evaluating how we can best support partners and make Microsoft software available to customers across all environments, including those of other cloud providers.”
OVHcloud said the complaint was filed jointly with “several companies.” It wouldn’t name the other companies.
As governments around the world have gone after big tech companies, Microsoft has not been at the center of attention. The company has positioned itself as having learned from its own antitrust battles two decades ago when the US Department of Justice and the EU sued the company for its business practices.

293,"March 2, 2022",UK Clears Microsoft’s $19.7B Nuance Acquisition,"


The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced this Wednesday its decision to clear Microsoft’s planned acquisition of artificial intelligence company Nuance Communications.
Although the CMA found that Nuance holds a “strong position in the supply of healthcare transcription software”, the watchdog found no reason for concern regarding competition in this sector following the proposed merger. 
The competition regulator said it is not referring the merger to a Phase 2 investigation under the provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002. “Based on the available evidence, the CMA does not believe that the Merged Entity would have the ability to foreclose Microsoft’s rivals.”
“In particular, the CMA considers that the Merged Entity would not be able to foreclose rivals by bundling patient administration tools, patient engagement tools, or remote healthcare tools with healthcare transcription software”, it added.
It ultimately said that the combined offering of the two companies was unlikely to cause a “substantial lessening of competition in the UK in relation to conglomerate effects”, and would not be taking the investigation any further. The UK follows both the European Union and the United States competition authorities in clearing the deal. 
Health transcription services are a mainstay of modern medical practice, taking health providers’ voice recordings and transcribing them into written – often electronic – formats. Such records are increasingly required for compliance, research, and other purposes, making this an attractive area for Artificial Intelligence developers such as Nuance.

294,"February 28, 2022",The Microsoft Open App Store Principles in Eight Points,"
By: Damien Geradin (The Platform Law Blog)
It is no secret that Microsoft has charted a rather different course compared to Apple and Google when it comes to ex ante regulation – a course aiming to embrace, rather than fight, regulation (see for example, this May 2021 blog post where Microsoft in principle voiced its support for the EU Digital Markets Act). It is also no secret that Microsoft is at odds with Apple’s (and, to a lesser extent, Google’s) app store policies, with the Seattle-based software company recently filing an amicus brief in support of Epic Games’ appeal before the Ninth Circuit against the ruling of Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. As discussed below, to some extent this reflects the starkly different approaches of Microsoft and Apple to cloud gaming, with Microsoft heavily investing in cloud gaming with its Xbox Cloud Gaming, and Apple “block[ing] the emergence of cloud gaming on iOS”, as the CMA found (see the excellent post of our colleague Stijn Huijts on this issue).
It is thus with great interest that I saw yesterday Microsoft’s Brad Smith announce a set of “Open App Store Principles” in what he describes as a proactive move to adapt ahead of regulation. Specifically:
Grounded in existing or forthcoming legislation: The Open App Store Principles are said to be grounded in app store legislation currently being considered across the world, including the US (this is presumably a reference to the Open App Markets Act, recently voted by the US Senate Judiciary Committee), the EU (the DMA), the Republic of Korea (see here), and the Netherlands (presumably this refers to the Dutch Competition Authority’s decision mandating Apple to allow dating app developers to use alternative in-app payment systems; as I explained earlier this week, Apple refuses to comply, begging the question of whether it is a threat to the rule of law).Scope: According to the blog post, the Open App Store Principles shall apply to “the Microsoft Store on Windows and to the next-generation marketplaces [Microsoft] will build for games”. Some of the principles will also immediately apply to the Xbox console store, with Microsoft committing to close the gap on the remaining principles over time (more on this later).Content: The announced principles are said to reflect Microsoft’s commitments in four areas:– Quality, safety, security, and privacy (principles 1-3): Microsoft commits to continue protecting user security and privacy, and allow developers to access its app store as long as they meet reasonable quality and safety standards.– Accountability (principles 4-5): Microsoft commits to hold its own apps at the same standard it holds rival apps, and not to use non-public information from the app store to compete against rivals (this reminds me of Article 6.1(a) of the DMA)).– Fairness and transparency (principles 6-7): Microsoft commits not to unreasonably self-preference its own apps and to be transparent about rules for promotion in its app store.– Developer choice (principles 8-11): In what I consider to be the most interesting part, Microsoft commits to, among others, (i) allow developers to use their own in-app payment processing system, and not disadvantage them if they do so; and (ii) allow developers to communicate directly with their users inside the app on, inter alia, pricing terms.– Operating systems: Finally, Microsoft commits to (i) continue allowing developers for Windows to make their apps available through alternative app stores or sideloading; (ii) continue providing such developers with timely access to interoperability information; and (iii) enable Windows users to use third party app stores and apps, including by changing defaults…

295,"February 20, 2022","Report Alleges Microsoft, Google Maybe Using Spam Ads To Stifle Competition","


Confidential data reviewed by POLITICO has revealed gatekeeper search engines are funneling low-value ads to smaller search partners.
The report alleges Alphabet’s Google and Microsoft Corp. are using the online advertising market to the detriment of smaller rivals. The action threatens to establish a new antitrust clash in Europe, reported PMNTS. 
These two tech giants appear to be inundating smaller search engine partners with spam ads while keeping the most valuable adverts for themselves, the report found.
The report comes a week after the European Publishers Council (EPC) — an association that includes The New York Times, Germany’s Axel Springer and the UK’s Guardian — filed a complaint with the European Commission against Google, asking the regulator to restore conditions for effective competition in the AdTech value chain.
The European Commission has been investigating Google’s advertising practices since last year, when it sent questionnaires to publishers and advertising companies asking them about the role of Google as middleman in the AdTech value chain.
In addition, the US Department of Justice has been expediting its investigation of Google’s alleged antitrust practices.
Last fall, Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s commissioner for competition, said the European Parliament and European Council should approve legislation regulating Big Tech as soon as possible.
The data, compiled by anonymous researchers working in the AdTech space, found that Google and Microsoft release “low-value and irrelevant ads” to their partners.

296,"February 9, 2022",Microsoft Commits To Openness In New App Store,"


Executives at Microsoft are pledging the company’s new video game app store will be governed by open-market principals, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday (Feb. 9).
These remarks were made to reporters ahead of meetings between Microsoft and lawmakers about the company’s landmark purchase of gaming giant Activision Blizzard, reported PYMNTS. 
Among the principles the company pledges to adopt for its store: developers won’t need to use a proprietary, something Apple has been criticized for by lawmakers and developers alike.
“We are more focused on adapting to regulation than fighting against it,” said Microsoft President Brad Smith.
Last month, Microsoft announced plans to acquire Activision for $75 billion, its largest purchase ever and a deal that would help bolster the company’s subscription gaming service Game Pass. The service gives users access to a catalog of games for a monthly fee. These users would get to play wildly popular franchises like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft if the deal goes forward.
As many observers have pointed out, the deal is also Microsoft’s bet on the burgeoning metaverse, a 3D world of immersive activities that mix with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).
The deal is subject to regulatory approval, with the US Federal Trade Commission trying to determine if the acquisition will hamper competition in the gaming world.

297,"February 8, 2022",Microsoft May Buy Cybersecurity Firm Mandiant,"


Microsoft is considering a deal to buy cybersecurity firm Mandiant, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.
Mandiant became a standalone entity again last year when FireEye Inc – which acquired the company in 2013 – sold its products business and the FireEye name for $1.2 billion to a consortium led by private-equity firm Symphony Technology Group.
Mandiant, which has a market capitalization of about $3.6 billion, focuses on cyber-incident response and cybersecurity testing.
A deal to buy Mandiant would help Microsoft beef up its products that protect its clients from cybersecurity threats. The software giant bought two smaller cybersecurity companies in 2021 and said it would spend $20 billion on cybersecurity over the next five years.
Cyberthreats have been rising in severity globally, with Microsoft’s products often in the crosshairs. In March 2021 attackers linked to China used flaws in the code of Microsoft’s Exchange software to break into tens of thousands of organizations. In a breach disclosed in December 2020, suspected Russian hackers compromised popular software from Texas-based firm SolarWinds Corp., inserting malicious code into updates for SolarWinds software, an attack that also impacted Microsoft and many of its customers.

Microsoft’s US$70 billion bid for Activision may be reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in what will become its first test to show its new approach to mergers since the joint consultation with the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division (DOJ) to review the merger guidelines, reported PYMNTS.
In the US, merger reviews are conducted by the FTC or the DOJ, depending on the sectors affected by the merger. If this merger is reviewed by the FTC, it will be the first big deal that FTC Chair Lina Khan, a noted critic of Big Tech, reviews from Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, or Microsoft. 
Related: Microsoft-Activision Deal To Face Antitrust Scrutiny
Khan has already displayed a tough approach to big deals since she was appointed by President Joe Biden in June 2021. Her first case was Nvidia’s US$40 billion planned acquisition of Arm, which the FTC sued to block in December 2021. The deal may never go to trial as the parties are reportedly considering walking away given the increasing number of regulatory hurdles, including national security concerns in the UK.
The second example, from January, is Lockheed Martin’s US$4.4 billion takeover of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings.
Perhaps the strongest evidence of Khan’s intentions to scrutinize Big Tech companies is the current litigation where the FTC is seeking to unwind Facebook’s acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram. The FTC will face an uphill road to prove allegations of harm in the court, as the judge expressed in his opinion, “whether the FTC will be able to prove its case and prevail at summary judgment and trial is anyone’s guess.” However, if the regulator succeeds, it will be the biggest divestment since Standard Oil was ordered to break up in 1911.

301,"August 2, 2022",Judge Rules Rumble’s Antitrust Suit Against Google Can Proceed,"


A California judge says video service Rumble can proceed with the early stages of an antitrust suit against Google. Rumble sued Google in 2021, alleging that it favored its own YouTube video platform in search results and the Android operating system.
Google urged the court to split the suit’s arguments and dismiss substantial parts of the reasoning as well as strike parts of the suit related to Android app preinstallation. Judge Haywood Gilliam declined to do so late last week, putting the case on track to proceed — although it could still be dismissed before it reaches trial.
Rumble’s suit overlaps with several ongoing Big Tech controversies. The company takes aim at Google’s deals with Android phone makers, who typically agree to preinstall bundles of Google apps and limit non-Google app pre-installations or changes to the operating system, sometimes in ways that antitrust watchdogs have found unlawful. It also alleges that Google unfairly loads the top results of searches for videos with YouTube links, burying Rumble results — similar to complaints made by “vertical” search engine providers over the past decades.
“Rumble’s success … has been far less than it could and should have been as a direct result of Google’s unlawful anticompetitive, exclusionary and monopolistic behavior,” the complaint asserts.
Rumble is also part of a conservative-friendly web ecosystem that has catered (with varying levels of exclusivity) to right-leaning users who claim they’ve been censored on larger platforms like Google. It filed its suit around the same time alternative social network Parler attempted to sue Amazon on antitrust grounds, but while that suit made some fairly tenuous claims about competition, Rumble’s plays on widely acknowledged concerns about Google’s ecosystem. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have both pushed for legislation that could limit the kind of “self-preference.

Microsoft also approached VMware, Dell, IBM and HP said the people familiar with the effort. It hasn’t yet asked Amazon to join the loose alliance, the people said. Amazon dominates the cloud-infrastructure industry with a 39% share of the 2021 global market ahead of Microsoft at No. 2 with a 21% share, according to research firm Gartner Inc. Amazon looms even larger in the business of selling cloud services to governments. Amazon’s cloud had a 47% share of the 2021 U.S. and Canada public-sector market orders, ahead of 28% for Microsoft, according to Gartner. The National Security Agency last year picked Amazon as the sole vendor for a cloud contract that could be worth potentially as much as $10 billion over the next decade, renewing an existing business relationship.

Russia’s competition watchdog fined Alphabet’s Google 2 billion roubles ($34.2 million) on Tuesday for abusing its dominant position in the video hosting market, the regulator said in a statement.
The decision is the latest multi-million dollar fine as part of Moscow’s increasingly assertive campaign against foreign tech companies.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) said the company had “abused its dominant position in the YouTube video hosting services market”, without providing additional details.

304,"July 20, 2022",Google Skirts Around Indonesia’s New Licensing Rules,"


Google was among the last remaining tech platforms yet to comply with Indonesia’s new licensing rules late on Wednesday, hours from a deadline to sign up and avoid having its services blocked in the country.
Registration is required under rules released in late 2020 that would give authorities broad powers to compel platforms to disclose data of certain users and take down content deemed unlawful or that “disturbs public order” within four hours if urgent, and 24 hours if not.
With a young, tech-savvy population of 270 million, Indonesia is a top-10 market in terms of user numbers for a host of social media companies.
“We are aware of the regulation’s requirements, and are in the process of taking appropriate action towards compliance,” a Google representative said, without elaborating.
The communications ministry has said firms that do not register before midnight Wednesday will be reprimanded, fined, and then blocked – a decision that will be reversed once they sign up.
While the ministry did not say when the block would take effect, it is unlikely to be immediate.
Twitter was among the latest companies to be added to a communications ministry list of foreign providers that have signed up.
In a statement on Wednesday afternoon the company said it had “taken appropriate steps to comply”.

305,"July 20, 2022","US Gov Panel Says Amazon, Facebook, Google Suppress Competition","


New internal documents released by the US House Judiciary Committee have revealed how Amazon, Facebook and Google favoured their own products and abused their dominance to suppress competition from their rivals.The new documents include internal Facebook documents, showing the company views itself as dominant in the social networking market and insulates itself from competitive threats.“Other newly-released documents include Google internal communications demonstrating how it leverages its control over the Android mobile operating system to prevent smartphone manufacturers from introducing products or services that compete with Google’s family of mobile apps,” the House Judiciary Committee said in a statement on Tuesday.Internal Amazon documents demonstrate how Amazon’s abuses its dominance over e-commerce to coerce third-party sellers to purchase other services from Amazon, such as fulfillment and distribution.“From Amazon and Facebook to Google and Apple, there’s no question that these unregulated tech giants have become too big to care and too powerful to ever put people over profits,” said House Antitrust Subcommittee Vice Chair, Pramila Jayapal (D-WA).“This report is clear: it’s time for Congress to act to protect consumers and promote competition. My Ending Platform Monopolies Act would be an important step towards reining in the power of Big Tech,” she added.The report came as the US lawmakers push to approve stronger antitrust legislation by the end of the year.The 450-page report details the findings and recommendations from a bipartisan investigation that included seven congressional hearings, the production of nearly 1.3 million internal documents and communications from the investigated firms and submissions from 38 antitrust experts.“The findings and recommendations clearly show that it is long-past time for Congress to enact meaningful updates to our antitrust laws to address the lack of competition in digital markets and the monopoly power of dominant platforms like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google,” said House Judiciary Committee Chairman, Jerrold Nadler (D-NY).“The public wants Congress to act, and there is legislation that is ready for a vote on the floor of both the House and the Senate. I implore leadership to move this legislation quickly,” Nadler added.

306,"July 19, 2022","New Documents May Aid Antitrust Case Against Google, Amazon","


Internal documents from Google and Amazon provided to Politico, show new examples of how the companies favor their own products over competitors’,  adding ammunition to the push for Congress to toughen antitrust laws.
The documents,  which include emails, memos and strategy papers, were shared by the House Judiciary committee, which obtained them as part of its long-running antitrust investigation of Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta that wrapped in October 2020 with a 450-page staff report. The documents were cited in the report, but had not previously been made available.
The documents bolster the committee’s claims that the internet giants illegally favor their own products, a practice that pending legislation to update antitrust laws would make more difficult.
“It is time for Congress to act,” Antitrust Subcommittee Chair David N. Cicilline (D-RI) said in a statement.
Heavily redacted internal Google documents appear to show, for example, how Google pressured mobile phone makers including Samsung to prioritize its own apps on their devices.
In a January 2014 email about recent meetings in South Korea with Samsung and LG, a Google executive describes “grave concerns” about a new Samsung service “competing with our core search experience.” Yet Google appeared open to Samsung launching a “smart assistant” service in China, where Google’s offerings are not available.
The newly released material, which also include emails and other documents from Amazon and Meta-owned Facebook, arrives as pressure is building on Congress, and in particular Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, to pass a bill that would block the internet giants from favoring their own products and services over those of competitors who rely on their platforms.

307,"July 19, 2022",Google Faces $1B Suit In UK Over App Store Practices,"


Google is facing trial in a $1.1 billion class-action lawsuit in the U.K. over claims that the company overcharged 19.5 million customers for app store purchases.
As Reuters reported Tuesday (July 19), the suit alleged Google abused its position by charging users commissions of up to 30% on apps such as Candy Crush and Tinder.
The suit, which is not expected to go to court before 2024, was brought by Liz Coll, a former digital policy manager at the non-profit group Citizens Advice. She alleged the Play Store commission is unlawful and in violation of British and European competition laws, and that Google had exploited its dominant position at the cost of U.K. Android users.
This case is one of many instances of regulators and consumers taking steps to rein in Big Tech companies like Google and Apple over alleged anti-competitive practices. The European Union alone has fined Google more than 8 billion euros ($8.2 billion) in the past few years over anti-trust tactics.
The past few weeks have seen the company make a series of concessions to regulators, such as offering to break up its ad business, in hopes of fending off court action.
The suit comes one day after the filing of an American lawsuit that accuses Google rival Apple of violating antitrust laws by using its Apple Pay to illegally profit from payment card issuers, making $1 billion a year in fees.
That case, filed Monday (July 18) by Hagens Berman and Sperling & Slater, seeks to represent a class of credit unions and financial institutions in the U.S. that issue cards designed to be used in tandem with Apple Pay.
“In the Android ecosystem, where multiple digital wallets compete, there are no issuer fees whatsoever, ” read the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. “The upshot is that card issuers pay a reported $1 billion annually in fees on Apple Pay and $0 for accessing functionally identical Android wallets. If Apple faced competition, it could not sustain these substantial fees.”

308,"July 18, 2022","Russia Fines Google, Again","


Russia imposed a nearly $365 million fine (21.1 billion rubles) on Google for failing to delete YouTube videos that go against the country’s laws, as reported earlier by Reuters. 
In a translated press release, Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor states that YouTube didn’t follow orders to remove “prohibited content,” which includes videos “promoting extremism and terrorism,” as well as supposedly false information about the war in Ukraine.
In March, the Roskomnadzor threatened to charge Google over its failure to remove “illegal” YouTube videos, stating the fee would start at 8 million rubles (~$94,675 USD at the time), with the possibility to climb to 20 percent of Google’s annual revenue. 
The 21.1 billion rubles reflects a chunk of Google’s yearly turnover in the country, but it’s unclear if Google will actually go through with paying the fine. Google didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment.
Google announced its plans to shut down its Russian operations in May, stating that government authorities seized its assets in the country and that it would be “untenable” to keep the branch functional. The search giant’s Russian subsidiary officially filed for bankruptcy last month.

309,"July 17, 2022",DOJ To Reject Google Concessions: Report,"


According to reports, the DOJ is getting ready to sue Google again for antitrust violations related to claims that its advertising technology division is restricting competition. 
The Google ad tech platform is a market for buying and selling advertising on websites and mobile applications. But since it controls the market, it has been under investigation lately. As a result, officials will likely revoke the search engine giant’s prior concessions to avoid a legal dispute.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday (July 8), citing individuals familiar with the situation, that Alphabet Inc.’s Google has provided concessions to prevent this U.S. antitrust lawsuit accusing the firm of abusing its weight in the advertising technology industry.
Google said earlier this week to Android Central that it has been collaborating with authorities to alleviate their worries. A corporate spokesman insisted that Google had no intentions to divest itself of its troubled advertising division.
The antitrust case might be filed soon. If granted, Google will face another antitrust complaint. Additionally, the Competition and Markets Authority is investigating whether Google unlawfully blocks external ad servers.
Last month, European Consumer Organization (BEUC), a consumer rights organization in Europe, filed a wave of privacy complaints against Google, charging the advertising behemoth with misleading account creation design that they claim leads users to consent to intrusive and excessive data processing.
Google seems to depend on user permission as its legal justification for profiling account users for ad targeting reasons. 
The GDPR regulations in Europe are meant to make it simple for users to choose privacy-protecting settings. Still, according to the complaint, Google allegedly breaks this guideline when you establish an account. Additionally, it highlights that Android users must have a Google account to download programs from Google Play.

311,"April 28, 2022",Amazon Refuses To Describe Its Search To Australian Watchdog,"


Amazon has declined to describe its product-search system to an Australian competition regulator that has heard complaints of large marketplace platforms giving preference to in-house wares.
The company’s withholding of the information sets the scene for a possible repeat of Australia’s 2021 showdown with Facebook and Alphabet’s Google, which resulted in those firms paying content royalties to the media.
The regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), mentioned Amazon’s stance in a report issued on Thursday that was part of the same five-year review of big-tech regulation that involved Facebook and Google.
The ACCC said in the report that it had surveyed 80 online merchants and that nearly half believed large marketplace platforms skewed searches and website presentation to favour in-house products.
Amazon had told the regulator it did not give an advantage to its own products but “the ACCC sought details about inputs of Amazon’s algorithms, which were not provided”, the report said.
As a result, “the ACCC does not have information about how Amazon’s algorithms produce search results”, the report said.
Amazon Australia director of public policy Michael Cooley said in a statement that the company’s offers were “the ones we think customers will prefer, regardless of whether it is from Amazon or one of our seller partners”.
“We provide data directly to Seller Partners to help them manage their businesses, and give key insights,” he added, without specifying which data the company provided.
Questionnaire results published with the report included several comments accusing Amazon of giving preference to its own products. One unnamed respondent wrote: “Amazon products are always listed first and then second-hand products are available in small print at the bottom of the listing”.
The ACCC noted that, unlike other large online retail markets, such as those of the United States and Britain, Australia’s was not dominated by Amazon. The company did not start operations in the country until 2017.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) is urging a Washington, DC, superior court to reconsider its decision to dismiss an antitrust case against Amazon brought by D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine (D).
“If left uncorrected, the Court’s ruling could jeopardize the enforcement of antitrust law by improperly raising the bar on plaintiffs challenging anticompetitive contractual restraints in the District of Columbia,” the DOJ attorneys wrote in a Thursday filing in support of Racine’s push for the court to reconsider its March dismissal.
The lawsuit alleges that Amazon has used anti-competitive practices by keeping third-party sellers from offering lower prices for products elsewhere.
Racine filed a motion earlier this month asking the court to reconsider the lawsuit. An Amazon spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A company spokesperson previously denied the lawsuit’s allegations in a statement when the case was filed last year.
“Sellers set their own prices for the products they offer in our store,” the spokesperson said at the time. “Amazon takes pride in the fact that we offer low prices across the broadest selection, and like any store we reserve the right not to highlight offers to customers that are not priced competitively.”
The department sent letters to lawmakers on the House and Senate Judiciary committees last month endorsing an antitrust proposal that aims to block tech giants from giving preferential treatment to their own products.

India’s antitrust body launched raids early on Thursday against two top domestic sellers of online retail giant Amazon, and some on Walmart’s Flipkart, following accusations of competition law violations, sources told Reuters.
Indian retailers, key supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have long contended that Amazon and Flipkart platforms benefit a few big sellers, via predatory pricing, though the companies say they comply with all Indian laws.
The two Amazon sellers figuring in Thursday’s raids were Cloudtail and Appario, two sources said on condition of anonymity, as the details were not public.
Two other sources said some sellers on Walmart’s Flipkart platform were also being raided by officers of the Competition Commission of India (CCI), but there were no immediate details.
“This is a significant development as generally CCI doesn’t do searches in non-cartel cases,” a former official of the competition regulator told Reuters.
“Doing dawn raids to unearth complex economic activities is a new domain for the regulator.”
Amazon, which has an indirect equity stake in both the sellers raided, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Flipkart.

314,"April 25, 2022",Amazon Seeks Black Friday NFL Game,"


The latest decision from NFL owners seems to align the league with Amazon Prime, which could translate into a Black Friday game streamed on Amazon Prime this year.
According to a report on Pro Football Talk, NFL owners passed a resolution that would expand the league’s already planned schedule by a single additional short-week game.
Although not yet confirmed, it’s an open secret that Amazon’s been sniffing around the concept of a Black Friday game for a couple of months now. It could be an effective way for the streaming giant to further enter NFL broadcasting after streaming Thursday Night Football games the last few seasons.
Amazon and the NFL have struck a number of lucrative deals in recent years, including for the coveted “Sunday Ticket” service, whic allows NFL fans to watch a wide variety of football games outside of their local markets. 
 Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio wrote in February that “Any attempt to televise a Friday game before the middle of December would raise questions regarding the league’s broadcast antitrust exemption. 
In exchange for the ability to sell the TV rights for all games in a bulk package and not on a team-by-team basis, the league can’t broadcast games on Fridays or Saturdays from the second Friday in September through the second Saturday in December.”

315,"April 21, 2022",Amazon To Compete Against Shopify With “Buy With Prime”,"


Amazon is making moves to boost its relationship with sellers as rival Shopify continues to expand its presence and swoop in on the eCommerce giant’s turf, according to a Thursday (April 21) press release.
Buy With Prime will allow select Amazon merchants to sell their listed merchandise directly from their own websites. The new perk makes Amazon’s payments and fulfillment services available at checkout. Shoppers will get the option of using their Amazon Prime membership for quick, no-charge delivery and other benefits. 
Amazon’s new seller Buy With Prime tool is invitation only and will have an undisclosed fee attached. 
Shopify is making its presence known and cranking up the competition, focusing on last-mile delivery acquisitions and making sellers happy. That last mile of delivery could be the deciding factor in whether a consumer shops at Amazon, Walmart, Shopify or any other eCommerce site. 
The Canadian firm is looking to snap up Deliverr, which would be its largest acquisition and would serve as a complement to its subscription-based software that allows users to set up an online store. It would also give sellers more access to offer fast delivery to customers who now expect to receive merchandise in a couple of days.
Last month, Shopify partnered with Shippo, which offers a large network of global and regional carriers as well as a shipping infrastructure integration. Sellers can integrate with Shippo’s application programming interface (API) and offer shipping directly from their own online storefronts.

316,"April 21, 2022","Apple, Amazon, Facebook Spend Big On Antitrust Lobbying","
Apple, Amazon and Meta spent record sums on federal lobbying through the first three months of the year as they fought bipartisan antitrust legislation, according to documents filed with Congress Wednesday night.
Apple spent more than $2.5 million on lobbying in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 71 percent from the same period last year. Meta spent nearly $5.4 million, up 13 percent from last year’s first quarter. Amazon shelled out nearly $5 million, a 4 percent increase.
The rise comes as the big four tech firms attempt to derail the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, a bill to prevent dominant digital platforms from favoring their own services and empower antitrust officials to more aggressively investigate tech giants.
Tech giants, along with tech-backed lobbying groups and former national security officials, have increasingly cited China and Russia in their effort to defeat the bill, claiming that the measure would strengthen U.S. adversaries by weakening the nation’s tech giants.
Apple and Google are leading the charge against the Open App Markets Act, which would block app stores from favoring their own apps in searches, requiring developers to use their payment systems and blocking users from using third-party app stores.  
Apple CEO Tim Cook has personally lobbied lawmakers to drop the latter measure and warned last week that it would “undermine privacy and security” of Apple users.
Google, whose CEO has also pushed back on the bill, spent nearly $3 million on lobbying in the first quarter, up 10 percent from the same period last year but down from previous years.

317,"April 17, 2022",DC AG Asks Court To Reconsider Amazon Antitrust Suit,"


A filing submitted on Thursday by District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine asked the state court overseeing his office’s case against Amazon to reconsider the oral decision it issued last month dismissing the suit. According to the motion, the court committed reversible error by misapplying the pleading standard, overlooking facts pleaded in the complaint, and arriving at its own factual conclusions.
The lawsuit, filed 11 months ago, asserts that Amazon controls between 50 and 70% of domestic online sales and maintains a monopoly in the online retail market in violation of the District of Columbia’s Antitrust Act. In particular, the complaint points to several written agreements including a pricing parity policy that Amazon allegedly imposed on third-party sellers which had the effect of creating an artificial price floor for goods sold across e-commerce platforms. 
The case is about “whether the written agreements acknowledged by the Court’s ruling have the potential to or are likely to cause anticompetitive effects,” this week’s motion says, pointing to factual allegations purportedly showing higher prices, less choice for consumers, and insulation of monopoly power. The attorney general argues that “at this stage of the proceeding, the Court is limited to ascertaining whether there is enough factual matter in the Complaint, taken as true, to make it plausible that discovery will ultimately reveal adequate evidence of those anticompetitive effects.”
In support, the motion also points to a recent ruling made by a Seattle, Washington federal court finding that facts “indistinguishable” from the instant ones were sufficient to survive Amazon’s dismissal bid.
Amazon will have a chance to oppose the filing, which, in the alternative, asks that the court allow the plaintiff to file an amended pleading. Amazon is represented byPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP.

318,"April 11, 2022",The Italian Competition Authority’s Decision in the Amazon Logistics Case: Self-preferencing and Beyond,"

By Claudio Lombardi1
  
 Introduction
In a long-awaited decision, the Italian Competition Authority (ICA) has found Amazon in breach of Article 102 TFEU. The ICA has defined the anticompetitive conduct in question as ‘self-preferencing’,2 although this term may not fully or adequately explain Amazon’s actions.
The case concerns a series of exclusive and irreplicable benefits accorded to vendors subscribing to ‘Fulfillment by Amazon’ (FBA), with which Amazon aimed at gaining a dominant position in the Italian market for logistics services at the expense of other efficient competitors, consumers, and competition as a whole.To determine whether this conduct infringed Art. 102 TFEU, the ICA has followed the standard method of defining the relevant market before establishing dominance and its abuse.  This article unpacks the ICA’s decision and considers its contribution to the development of competition law in this sector.  In particular, the article considers some of the differences between this decision and the Google case regarding the definition of self-preferencing practices, claiming that this definition might be inadequate to fully describe Amazon’s conduct and the ICA’s decision. Finally, the article discusses some of the drawbacks and limitations of the ICA’s decision.
 
II. The facts of the case: a primer
Amazon’s website operates two sales channels simultaneously. On the one hand, it sells goods that it owns directly. On the other hand, it operates as a platform where third-party vendors can sell their goods (i.e. the Amazon Marketplace,  ‘AM’), similar to other e-commerce platforms such as eBay.
The conduct at issue concerns the relationship between Amazon.it, third-party sellers, and the logistics service providers operating on the AM. Currently, a third-party seller active on Amazon can manage the logistics of its products in two ways. It can independently operate the storage, logistics, and delivery; or outsource it to an independent operator. This operator can be Amazon itself, or another firm. If the seller decides to use Amazon’s logistics network (ALN), they are requested to purchase a service called ‘Fulfilled by Amazon’ (FBA). If they entrust an independent logistics firm instead, Amazon defines the operation as a ‘Merchant Fulfilment Network’ (MFN).
FBA is an integrated logistics service that includes: (i) warehousing and inventory management for retailers at Amazon’s distribution centres; (ii) fulfilment of orders received on Amazon.it, including packaging and labelling; (iii) shipping, transportation, and delivery; (iv) returns management; and (v) customer service.
Amazon’s warehousing and shipping rates have increased considerably in recent years. Despite this, most third-party sellers use the FBA services as, on the whole, it is preferable to switching to an independent logistics service provider because of the unique advantages FBA gives on the Amazon Marketplace.
The hypothesis that the ICA sought to verify in this case was whether these benefits were designed, or were anyway sufficient to allow Amazon to leverage its dominant power in the e-commerce sector to monopolize the market for e-commerce logistics to the detriment of competition in the industry.

III. The relevant markets
According to the ICA, the conduct mainly concerned two markets:

the market for intermediation services on e-commerce platforms; and
the market for logistics services for e-commerce. 

i. The market for intermediation services on e-commerce platforms.
Brokerage services on e-commerce platforms (marketplaces) are provided by the owner and operator of the platform to third-party vendors selling their products on the platform. Considering Amazon to be a two-sided transaction platform, the ICA defined the relevant market on each side of the platform using a multi-market approach.3
According to the ICA, the market for the supply of intermediation services on e-marketplaces is characterised by the absence of demand-side substitutability with other retail channels. Brick and mortar sales, sales through proprietary websites, and price comparison services are complementary to e-commerce sales rather than substitutes. As the authority argues, for both consumers and sellers, these are “substantially different sales channels, complementary and not alternative to each other” (Page 142). Thus, e-commerce transaction platforms were considered to be an independent relevant market. The ICA included all e-commerce marketplaces in this category, both hybrid (such as Amazon itself, selling proprietary products and third-party products simultaneously) and traditional e-commerce platforms selling only third-party products (such as Ebay).
Based on this market definition, the ICA concluded that Amazon occupied a position of super-dominance in the Italian e-commerce market. All market indicators showed that Amazon had increased its market shares in the e-commerce sector steadily (to about 80% in 2019), together with its popularity amongst third-party sellers, and that its main competitors were marginalized.
Figure 2: Revenues of e-commerce operators.
Source: ICA
Moreover, the market is also characterized by high barriers to entry, due to “loyalty and stickiness of consumer preferences, variety and breadth of services offered, network effects, brand popularity and reputation all hinder the possibility of reaching a minimum size sufficient to exert a competitive constraint” (p. 167).
ii. The market for logistics services for e-commerce.
Logistics services, in this case, encompass order fulfilment, warehouse management, and delivery (in some cases, including also returns). The ICA considered the rapid expansion of a national market for e-commerce logistics services, in which players with different characteristics and sizes operate on the supply side. Given the high start-up costs, several logistics companies are changing their business strategy through vertical integration or collaboration agreements with other companies. The B2C logistics for e-commerce requires specific investments given its characteristics, such as instant fulfilment of multiple small orders on demand, which sets it apart B2B logistics, where some of these companies were already operating.
The growth of the e-commerce industry has also attracted new entrants in the markets for integrated logistics services in Italy.4 However, as the type of service needs dedicated technologies, space, know-how, and workers, these new entrants have made significant investments, especially for the adoption of advanced technologies to integrate the different logistics phases.
These operators offer a fulfilment service dedicated to e-commerce, similar to FBA.
However, their investment is conditioned upon the possibility of tapping into a sufficiently large pool of demand.
 
IV. The Abuse
The ICA has concluded that Amazon was able to illegally leverage its position of super dominance in the Italian e-commerce market to gain a significant advantage over competing operators in the Italian e-commerce logistics industry to the detriment of third-party sellers and consumers.
The strategy, according to the antitrust authority, was also likely to strengthen Amazon’s dominant position in the national market for intermediation services on marketplaces.
The advantages of FBA are, in particular: (i) non-application of performance metrics to third-party sellers; (ii) obtaining the Prime badge; (iii) higher probability of being awarded the BuyBox; (iv) possibility to participate in special events and offers; and (v) eligibility for “Free Shipping via Amazon”.
In particular, access to Prime members seems to be crucial for most vendors as the purchases made by Prime consumers in 2019 amounted to approximately [80-90%] of the total value of transactions on Amazon.it, and [70-80%] of the products purchased by these users had a Prime badge. (Page 187)
The ICA also observed that the conduct had the effect of discouraging retailers from multi-homing their logistic services. The high costs of the FBA service, including the MCF multi-channel management, and the costs associated with operating multiple warehouses simultaneously were already sufficient to disincentivize retailers from multi-homing. In addition to that, the ICA noted that Amazon’s “abusive pressure” to adopt their logistics services was also geared towards pre-empting multi-homing and that the strategy had already worked in their favor as “reflected in the drastic worsening of the competitive position of the second player in the brokerage services market, eBay” (Page 188).
Amazon argued that the benefits were bestowed only on FBA subscribers because of the “superiority” of Amazon’s services, which would ensure a certain level of quality. The ICA, however,  considered that Amazon failed to provide any evidence of said greater quality of service. Moreover, the attribution of sales advantages was not linked to the sales performance of retailers. On the contrary, FBA retailers received a more lenient treatment in their evaluation and control requirements than did those who turned to MFN.
A. Classification of the Abusive Practice
The ICA defines the conduct above as “a single, complex and articulated exclusionary strategy, implemented by the Amazon group in violation of Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)” (188).
More specifically, the ICA defined the conduct as self-preferencing, observing that Amazon used its super-dominant position in the e-commerce industry to increase third-party seller demand for its logistics service, to the detriment of competing services.
Amazon has argued that their conduct cannot be classified as an abuse ofdominant position in the form of self-preferencing due to the lack of relevant case law. The company has also highlighted the differences between this case and the Commission’s recent decision in Google Search (Shopping), the only case so far in which self-preferencing was qualified as autonomous abusive conduct. Moreover, Amazon did not coerce retailers to adopt FBA because they remained free to decide whether they wanted to use the service, and no minimum inventory requirements were imposed.
The ICA respondedby observing that the designation of the conduct as abusive does not depend on whether it falls within a particular classification, but on the identification of substantive features of the abusive conduct. (P. 190)
Regardless of the nomen iuris used for the specific conduct, the ICA held that it has submitted all evidence needed to prove an abuse of dominance.
Indeed, the classification of the conduct as self-preferencing might be inaccurate if one considers a narrow interpretation of the Google Shopping case. However, the conduct is not about tying either, let alone bundling of services. The conduct hinges more precisely on leveraging the company’s dominance in the e-commerce sector (through special offers and treatment) in order to favor the purchase of its logistics services, which were neither better priced nor necessarily of better quality than competing logistics services.
In other words, “Amazon has artificially combined two distinct services: the presence on the platform at remunerative conditions (possibility of not being subject to the evaluation of one’s own performance, of offering products with the Prime label, of selling during special events and of having a high chance of winning the BuyBox) and the FBA service for the fulfilment of orders – in order to create an illicit incentive to purchase FBA, in the absence of alternative ways of accessing the same advantages, apart from the use of FBA” (Page 191).
B. Efficiencies
According to the ICA, there is no commercial or technical reason to justify the link between the benefits granted to subscribers and FBA usage, nor does the conduct find justification on grounds of efficiency. In other words, while the evidence suggests that other logistics operators are able to provide services of comparable quality,5 the respondent undertaking has failed to prove the contrary. And, indeed, the ICA observed, Amazon has introduced a Seller Fulfilled Prime (SFP) program in 2021, in the midst of the ICA’s investigation. Thanks to SFP, sellers can undergo a qualification process that recognizes their warehouse management capabilities according to standards deemed adequate to the Prime experience. Then, using Amazon-approved delivery services deemed “suitable,” sellers may access the same benefits guaranteed to third-party sellers using FBA. However, SFP did not put an end to the anticompetitive conduct as it is not an alternative to FBA.
The SFP service is reserved for a particular class of retailers and conditioned to strict contractual limitations. SFP is geared toward retailers selling products with a low turnover rate or needing more flexibility in the provision of their service, such as packaging. The high tariffs charged by Amazon for long-term storage of products and the high standardization of certain elements of the service render Amazon’s marketplace either too expensive or too restrictive for these retailers. The ICA reckoned that they ultimately represent a portion of the demand for logistics services that is unreachable to Amazon, as it does not fit the FBA conditions.
To date, under SFP, Amazon does not merely set the standards necessary to qualify for and obtain the Prime label, but also defines the terms and conditions of the contractual relationship between SFP sellers and Prime carriers, going so far as to negotiate with the latter the price of their delivery services to sellers. Thus, managing the fulfilment of an order from a third-party seller included in SFP is still entirely dependent on Amazon, both in the choice of carrier and in the terms and conditions of the service provided to sellers.
Such a constraint was deemed as “completely unjustified and invasive of the freedom of negotiation between the carrier and its customers” (Page 209).
Today’s SFP does not allow, therefore, the emergence of an autonomous offer, independent from Amazon, capable of intercepting the demand for delivery services and warehouse logistics – or integrated logistics – offered by Prime level to retailers on Amazon.it.
In this sense, FBA is not only in competition with the integrated logistics services offered by other operators, but is also able to intercept the demand for carrier delivery services only, expressed by retailers who carry out in-house upstream logistics activities (Page 213)
 
V. The Effects of the Abusive S qtrategy
The investigation has uncovered several exclusionary effects related to the conduct.
First, the conduct had the effect of excluding potential competition, as well as industrial and technological development. By linking all the benefits in terms of visibility and increased sales performance on the marketplace to the FBA subscription, Amazon’s strategy has succeeded in curbing the development of competing integrated logistics services by innovative operators.
The second anticompetitive effect concerns operators that had already invested in this market but were not given the opportunity to “compete on equal terms with Amazon”. In order to reach the minimum efficient size and be competitive in the market, new e-commerce logistics operators need to intercept the demand of a significant number of players, which can be found only on the AM (Page 213).
Third, the conduct also has the effect of increasing Amazon’s power in the delivery industry. The use of third-party couriers for delivery has declined from 100% in 2016 to 30-40% in 2019. (Page 216) In this way, Amazon has further increased its bargaining power vis-à-vis other market players which, being both competitors and suppliers of the delivery service, see their ability to react to Amazon’s strategies increasingly diminished.
A. Effects on Other E-commerce Platforms
Amazon’s alleged conduct has also eroded the market shares of other e-commerce platforms as it made it more difficult to multi-home logistics services and thus operate on these platforms and on Amazon simultaneously. While Amazon offers a multi-channel logistics service (MCF), very few retailers adopted it due to the high operating costs. (Page 220)
Equally important because of the confusion it is likely to generate in consumers is the fact that a retailer’s order packages handled through MCF are marked with the Amazon logo even when the order comes from a competing platform. This is a marketing choice that can “cannibalize” a retailer’s sales on other platforms and, consequently, decrease the profitability of a multi-homing option. (Page 221)
As a result of this strategy, many retailers have left other marketplaces to be active only on Amazon.it, to the detriment of competition from other e-commerce platform operators. (Page 222)
 
VI. The Sanction
The decision includes a 1.2 billion euros fine, a cease-and-desist order, and a set of behavioral remedies. The hefty fine imposed by the antitrust authority in this decision was justified by the need to ensure effective deterrence of the sanction. Moreover, consideringthat the Amazon group achieved a global turnover in 2020 of more than €330 billion, and the importance of Amazon at the global level, the ICA increased the amount of the sanction by 50%. (Page 231)
Perhaps even more importantly for the e-commerce behemoth, the ICA has imposed additional measures meaning Amazon has to cease the anticompetitive conduct and offer equal treatment to all vendors using logistics operators that meet objective standards for the fulfilment of online orders. These standards need to be clearly defined, reasonable, transparent, and applied in a non-discriminatory manner. (Page 235)
The decision states that this can be achieved by reconfiguring the current SFP programme so that Amazon defines such standards alongside  requirements for sellers to participate in SFP, but refrain from any intermediary role between third-party sellers and the logistics operators. The defined standards will be applied uniformly to offers operated by Amazon through its logistics network (i.e., Amazon Retail offers and those of third-party retailers participating in FBA) and to all offers operated by third-party sellers that qualify in SFP. (Page 235)
Moreover, SFP and FBA’s sales shall be subject to the same system of monitoring and verification of compliance with the Prime standards. Monitoring of compliance with the standards and any changes to these standards should be carried out by an independent trustee.
Amazon will have to give full visibility on its platform and in its promotional campaigns to the existence of the SFP programme and the possibility to access Prime via SFP. (Page 236)
 
Conclusion
The ICA’s decision comes at a time when a handful of digital platforms have accumulated sweeping powers in the real economy, while their scope has also crept to include formerly unrelated sectors. Such concerns were also lately addressed with the adoption of the EU Digital Markets Act.
In an official statement, Amazon has revealed that they will appeal the ICA’s decision because the sanction and obligations imposed are unjustified and disproportionate. The e-commerce behemoth sees its role as an essential complement of small and medium-sized businesses in the country and a driver to their growth. As Amazon’s logistics services are optional, the company argues in the official statement, retailers choose them for the higher quality offered, not because they are coerced to do so.
Moreover, the company contests, in the same statement, also its position of dominance in the Italian retail industry, claiming that the market definition should include all retail channels (online and offline).
It seems, therefore, that the appeal to the administrative court will not be limited to the sanctions, despite the initial narrow focus of the statement. Amazon may consequently try to challenge the decision on all its substantive elements, from the market definition to the imposition of remedial measures.
The ICA has defined a relevant market including most of the e-commerce platforms (traditional, proprietary, and hybrid, horizontal and vertical), but excluding brick-and-mortar sellers. Assuming that Amazon’s dominance in the Italian e-commerce market will be confirmed, the administrative court will have the role to establish whether Amazon fell short of its special responsibility not to allow its behaviour to impair genuine and undistorted competition (Intel v Commission, C‑413/14 P, U:C:2017:632, paragraph 135).
Amazon’s objections finding that there are differences with Google/Alphabet’s self-preferencing case are not misplaced, but not for the reasons for now only sketched out by the company.
Alphabet relied on its own platform alone to redirect consumers by fine-tuning the website’s design. Amazon, on the other hand, had set up a series of connected contractual arrangements with third parties to create the exclusionary effects under scrutiny. Moreover, although not sufficiently evidenced, the ICA’s investigation suggests that Amazon may be exploiting its position of dominance. The decision often mentions the fact that Amazon’s logistics services are more expensive than the competition. But again, the ICA focuses on the exclusionary effects of the infringement, thus purporting little evidence on this point.
The case law shows that not every exclusionary effect is inherently harmful to competition, because competition on the merits might result in the elimination or marginalization of less efficient competitors (see Post Danmark C‑209/10, EU:C:2012:172, paragraph 22, and Intel v Commission C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632, paragraph 134). However, in this case, the set of advantages set up by Amazon are designed or at least have the effect of excluding, from what seems to be an essential facility, as efficient competitors. When asked, Amazon was not able indeed to submit evidence of the superiority of its logistics services. While, on the contrary, most merchants vouched for some of the competitor’s quality of service but declared their intention to stick to Amazon’s for the higher visibility this would bring.
Amazon’s conduct does not resolve in an outright refusal to grant access to an essential facility, but rather in imposing unfavourable conditions leading to the elimination of competition in the e-commerce logistics market. Moreover, this conduct has had the effect of reinforcing Amazon’s dominance in the e-commerce sector by hindering multi-homing. In other words, Amazon’s conduct deviates from competition on the merits when it leverages its super dominance in the e-commerce to exclude competitors in the logistics market.
The lack of definitive evidence of the superiority of Amazon’s logistics also hampers the possibility of assessing the pro-consumer benefits of such practices. On the other hand, in the ICA’s decision there is little evidence about direct consumer harm. Although, on this point, it is important to remark that Article 102 TFEU protects consumers not just from acts that directly hurt them, but also from practices that harm them indirectly through their impact on competition (see Post Danmark, C‑209/10, EU:C:2012:172, paragraph 20).
Finally, the measures adopted, albeit severe, could not solve the problem of removing the barriers to multi-homing. As most sellers have already adopted FBA, and considering the high switching and the multi-homing costs, logistics operators may still find it difficult to enter this market.
Even assuming that the Italian administrative courts will confirm the ICA’s decision on the merits, it is likely that its effects will be mostly palliative, especially for other e-commerce players.

President Joe Biden on Wednesday expressed support for efforts to unionize Amazon workers, after one of the company’s warehouses voted to join a union last week.
“The choice to join a union belongs to workers alone,” Biden said in remarks at the national conference of North America’s Building Trades Unions. “By the way, Amazon, here we come. Watch.”
On Friday, workers at an Amazon warehouse on New York’s Staten Island voted overwhelmingly to join the Amazon Labor Union, a grassroots organization made up of current and former company employees. The election outcome was a watershed moment for labor organizers, who’ve sought to unionize Amazon warehouse and delivery workers for years.
Amazon has long opposed unions among its workforce and ran an aggressive campaign to discourage workers from unionizing at the Staten Island warehouse, just as it did at an Alabama warehouse last spring, where workers rejected unionization. A do-over election at the Alabama warehouse concluded Friday, but the results hang on a number of challenged ballots.
In March 2021, Biden endorsed union drives happening in Alabama and across the country, but he stopped short of naming Amazon specifically. He also discouraged employers from interfering in elections.

320,"December 23, 2021",Facebook Is Appealing UK’S Order To Sell Giphy,"
Facebook is appealing the UK’s ruling that it must sell animated images platform Giphy. Facebook is saying that the evidence does not support the finding that the deal is a threat to its rivals or could impact competition in display advertising, reported Reuters. 
Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) ordered Meta to sell Giphy, which it acquired for a reported $400 million in May 2020, last month after it decided the remedies offered by the U.S. company did not answer its concerns.
“We are appealing the CMA’s Giphy decision and will seek a stay of the CMA’s order to divest,” a Meta spokesperson said on Thursday. “The decision to block the deal is wrong on the law and the facts, and the evidence does not support the CMA’s conclusions or remedy.”
Related: UK Watchdog Orders Facebook To Sell Giphy Over Competition Concerns
Half of traffic to Giphy’s huge library of looping videos comes from Meta’s platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, per Reuters. 
The appeal will go now to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, a specialized court with vast experience in reviewing this type of decisions. The theories of harm that the tribunal will need to analyze are evidence-driven and the regulator may face an uphill road to probe its findings in court. This is because the analysis involves hypothetical scenarios where the court needs to decide what effects the merger would cause in the market, leaving certain discretion for the interpretation of the facts. However, the CMA has been able to prove similar theories of harm in other cases.
The relevance of this case, is not in the case itself, as it is immaterial for Meta, but it is on the consequences that a strict application of competition rules may have for small firms, and venture capital investors, who seek acquisitions as an exit strategy. This is particularly relevant for Giphy, which after 18 months of investigation, may be back to square one looking for alternatives to get funds. While this is not an excuse to allow a more permissible approach by regulators when they find antitrust concerns, it is not the first time that the CMA finds itself in a similar situation.

321,"December 9, 2021",Democrats Want Probes On Whether Facebook Misled Advertisers,"


Two powerful Senate Democrats are calling federal enforcers to probe whether Facebook misled customers and investors about key advertising metrics, an allegation at the heart of whistleblower Frances Haugen’s legal complaints about the company, reported the Washington Post. 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the chair of the Banking subcommittee on economic policy, sent a letter Thursday to the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission asking them to look into whether high-level company executives knew that the company “meaningfully and consistently inflated” a key metric about how many people in a given area could view an ad. Advertisers factored this metric into decisions about ad buys.
“Facebook is not above the law,” she wrote in the letter, shared exclusively with The Washington Post. “The company’s executives cannot mislead investors, the SEC, its advertising customers, and the public about a core metric of its business model with impunity if such actions violate federal wire fraud or securities laws.”
Warren’s letter comes closely on the heels of another senior Democrat’s similar request. Sen. Maria Cantwell (Wash.), chair of the Commerce Committee, on Wednesday called the Federal Trade Commission to look into whether the company deceived its advertising customers on these same metrics. She asked the agency to investigate whether the company might have misrepresented its processes for ensuring brand safety, citing documents revealed by Haugen suggesting the company misrepresented its efficacy at removing hate speech.

The chair of the US Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday asked a regulator to investigate whether Meta Platforms’ Facebook misled its advertising customers and the public about the reach of its advertisements, reported Reuters. 
In a letter to Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan seen by Reuters, Senator Maria Cantwell said “evidence suggests that Facebook may have deceived its advertising customers about its brand safety and advertising metrics” and “may have engaged in deceptive practices.”
Cantwell added that “public information suggests that Facebook’s potential misrepresentations about brand safety and advertising metrics may be unfair, as well as deceptive.”
She said “a thorough investigation by the Commission and other enforcement agencies is paramount, not only because Facebook and its executives may have violated federal law, but because members of the public and businesses are entitled to know the facts regarding Facebook’s conduct.”
Cantwell cited a 2020 Senate report that Facebook reportedly controlled approximately 74% of the social media market.

323,"December 8, 2021",200 US News Publishers Sue Google & Facebook Over Market Dominance,"


A group of 30 newspaper publishers, including Seattle-based Robinson Newspapers, have sued Google and Facebook over the way the social and search giants profit from news content at the expense of the publications that produce it.
The lawsuits, outlined in a story by Axios, involve more than 200 individual publications and are based on a central antitrust premise: that the two tech companies are so pervasive in online advertising that they illegally siphon up revenue that would otherwise go to local news.
The litigation’s goal, according to the Axios report, is “to recover past damages to newspapers” caused by Big Tech companies, according to a lawyer representing the newspapers.
Filed in September, the Robinson lawsuit blames the two tech companies for a sharp decline in revenue. “Defendants’ anticompetitive and monopolistic practices have had a profound effect upon our country’s free and diverse press, particularly the newspaper industry,” the lawsuit states.
“Since 2006, newspaper advertising revenue, which is critical for funding high-quality journalism, fell by over 50%.”

324,"December 6, 2021",Towards A Dynamic Competition Approach To Big Tech Merger Enforcement: The Facebook-Giphy Example,"
This paper explores how to elevate the importance of innovation and dynamic competition in antitrust enforcement. It explains that neglect of innovation stems from the employment of static frameworks and equilibrium models, when disequilibrium is characteristic of the competitive environment. The prescription advanced to remedy this lacuna is a focus on evolutionary, capability, and complexity economics. However, the adoption of new mental models, while obviously necessary, will not come easy because of the catch-up work that the enforcement agencies and scholars must do to operationalizing new enforcement methodologies. It requires de-emphasizing narrow efficiency and incentive issues while focusing on the impact of business conduct on innovation, capabilities, and ecosystems. Competition agencies will need to clear out the clutter of unhelpful and distracting constructs that are the residue of industrial age and neoclassical thinking. Fresh insights and better societal outcomes and a deeper understanding of digital platforms and digital transformation can result. Attention (albeit cursory) is given to the Facebook-Giphy acquisition as an example of how one might begin to look at dynamic competition issues.

By David J. Teece1
  
I. INTRODUCTION
Dynamic (Schumpeterian) competition is engendered by product and process and service innovation. Such competition is extremely powerful. It does more than bring about price reductions. It also brings innovation and service improvement that customers enjoy. A better understanding of dynamic competition in general, and of organizational capabilities, business models, and ecosystems in particular, would result in better competition policy frameworks and tools to analyze Big Tech behavior, including merger and acquisitions (“M&A”) activity.
I have endeavored (with co-authors) to advance a dynamic competition paradigm for the last 35 years.2,3,4,5,6,7 It is heartening that enforcement agencies, most notably the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”), and some scholars are now recognizing the need to abandon static concepts of competition in favor of dynamic ones. However, because law and economics scholarship has studiously avoided this concept for at least a generation, there is much work to be done in order to operationalize it in a policy useful manner. In this paper, I begin to outline how this might be done by endeavoring to embed recent developments in evolutionary economics and in capability theory into antitrust analysis.
Core to the dynamic competition perspective is a belief that competition policy must prioritize innovation as a policy goal and adopt analytical frameworks that calibrate dynamism and innovation. Moreover, in order to support and advance innovation, it is critical for competition policy to embrace an intermediate to long-term orientation. Short termism is not only the enemy of good management; it is the enemy of good competition policy. A new (operational) framework will require less reliance on the traditional tools of antitrust economics such as market definition and more reliance on the assessment of the business conduct and the impact of M&A transactions on the robustness of innovation in and across business and platform ecosystems. New ecosystem specific metrics can become a good proxy to inform for what is traditionally thought of as “competitive effects.”
The goal here is to advance a conceptual competition policy framework that (I) is undergirded by a systematic (and not ad hoc) theory of innovating digital firms; (II) recognizes that capabilities, not market positions per se, undergird business performance; (III) understands the origins of rents in the digital economy; (IV) offers operational welfare criteria; and (V) provides predictors of long-term competitive effects under uncertainty. However, to bring about improvements in mental models, we must first understand how we got to where we are.
 
II. DYNAMIC COMPETITION PARADIGM: IGNORED IN ECONOMICS BUT ACCEPTED IN TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT
A. Intellectual History
The theory of dynamic competition has prestigious intellectual origins, but it is also one of enduring scholarly and policy marginalization. Schumpeter stands as the father of theories of dynamic competition. Schumpeter observed almost a century ago that dynamic competition is much more effective at improving consumer welfare than is static competition. He analogized static versus dynamic competition to the difference between bombardment and forcing a door. Dynamic competition is so much more important that “it becomes a matter of comparative indifference whether competition in the ordinary sense functions more or less promptly; the powerful lever that in the long run expands output and brings down prices is in any case made of other stuff.”8
The “other stuff” Schumpeter referred to is innovation, which, through the introduction of new products and processes, embraces a more powerful form of competition that both erodes and destroys existing profit streams.9 Unfortunately, Schumpeter did not make his perspective operational in any meaningful sense. Nor did he draw distinctions between types of technologies. And it remains open to interpretation whether the “creative destruction” that Schumpeter talked about is a “continuous” process, or one that occurs in “perennial gales,” leaving open the question of what should be done in the interim.
Hayek and other Austrian economists did not fare better than Schumpeter in terms of policy influence. The essence of competition within the Austrian school is the dynamic pattern by which competition arises and proceeds, not the equilibrium never attained. Because this perspective was inconsistent with optimization and equilibrium models that economists favor, it was largely ignored by the mainstream and has therefore had almost no impact on public policy formulation and implementation.
An opportunity for dynamic competition to receive attention by competition economists occurred at the time when the Chicago School bequeathed to the world the field of law and economics in the 1960s; but the opportunity was missed. Chicago made a magnificent intellectual contribution to policy by injecting economics into the law. Nobel Laureate Ronald Coase’s “The Problem of Social Cost” was perhaps the beginning of that new field.10 Insights and methodologies spilled over to the emerging subfield of antitrust economics. Microeconomic theory was employed to provide new and valuable insights.
Unfortunately, microeconomic theory, both back then and now, affords little room for incorporating technological innovation. In my own research I complained bitterly about this beginning in the late 1980’s. When considered by Chicagoans and post-Chicagoans alike, R&D and investments in innovation were just costs with uncertain benefits. Efficiency, not innovation and growth, was seen as the pathway for the business enterprise to maintain competitiveness and deliver benefits to consumers. The standard tools of micro-economics under perfect or oligopolistic competition were often employed. Firms were viewed rather primitively as “production functions.” Along the way, Robert Bork urged the antitrust community to use the model of perfect competition “as a guide to reasoning about actual markets,” and to illustrate allocative efficiency.11 Table 1 outlines the underlying features and theoretical structures.

The post-Chicago antitrust revolution of the 1980s did little to change the direction of travel. Competition policy continued to rest heavily on neoclassical economics, and was heavily theory driven.12 Stylized models of competition were embraced that left little room for innovation. When innovation was considered, the focus was always on how competition drives innovation. How innovation drives competition was ignored.
As competition policy became more theory-driven, the analytical tools used have tended to oversimplify still further hard-to-model empirical phenomena, such as the impact of innovation on competition. Game theory, for example, supplied general explanations to empirical regularities found in oligopoly markets but has failed to give predictions reflective of the complexity of marketplace competition because it is dependent upon unattainable exactitude in the specification of firms’ strategies and timing of actions.13
The well-known, and elegant, modern theory of multisided markets has similar shortcomings. Multisided market theory has produced multiple efficiency and inefficiency possibility theorems, without however supplying clear policy guidance to real-world decisionmakers. And when economists have tried to be more empirical and moved to consider technological change, then, innovation has been measured by proxies like patent counts and R&D expenditure, which give at best crude insights and occasional clues about the complexity of the processes involved in innovation-led dynamic competition. While there has been some limited progress, static competition perspectives still dominate the analytical models employed in competition policy. Despite the explicit recognition of dynamic competition by the UK CMA, we are still far from the coherent paradigm change called for by some agency officials, as discussed below.
B. The Temptation of the Dynamic Competition Paradigm
The need for competition policy to consider dynamic competition has been apparent long before the advent of Big Tech firms and the emergence of the current debacle in competitive policy globally. In 1985, the former head of the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division, William F. Baxter, wrote “the contribution of technological advances to our economic well-being is very substantial when compared to the damage that could be caused by restrictive behavior the antitrust laws seek to halt.”14 In 1988, antitrust legal scholar Phil Areeda predicted that whether antitrust can meet the challenges of the next century depends on “It’s receptivity to the principles of efficiency, growth, and innovation.”15
25 years later, Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Commissioner Thomas Rosch found that circumstances had not changed very much. Attempting to explain why the enforcement agencies had failed to embrace dynamic competition, his candor was both revealing and concerning:
Antitrust enforcement has historically focused on static [rather] than dynamic analysis…for a number of reasons. First the antitrust community… both lawyers and economists…have far greater familiarity and comfort with static analysis rather than dynamic analysis. Second, there is less incentive for parties to take the time to develop arguments based on dynamic analysis. Third, there is the perception – right or wrong – that dynamic analysis is less well developed and less measurable than static analysis.16
Almost a decade later, Commissioner Christine Wilson of the FTC lamented again that frameworks that incorporated dynamic competition had been neglected noting that “the economic literature also acknowledges that innovation over the long run will deliver very large consumer welfare gains.” She went on to note that competition policy authorities “routinely struggle to account for dynamic effects.”17
Finally, about 5 years ago, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) stressed that “the methodology of competition authorities should move from a focus on static competition towards dynamic competition” without, however, lessening their “commitment to the rigor of evidence-based enforcement.”18 And in Beijing in 2018 Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim noted that:
“With an eye to promoting dynamic competition, I humbly submit that competition law enforcers around the world must give careful consideration to the interests that drive innovation, including by allowing innovation to reap the full rewards of their investments in research and development.”19
Areeda’s, Baxter’s, Rosch’s, Wilson’s, the OECD’s, and Delrahim’s calls to integrate innovation and dynamic competition  into policymaking have, with minor exceptions (such as the initial steps of the UK CMA), remained unanswered.
Models of innovation driven competition have nevertheless been developed and understood outside of the field of economics… in the innovation management literature. Clay Christensen’s “Disruption” model is outlined in The Innovator’s Dilemma. He sought to answer two main questions: (a) why is durable competition advantage so difficult to maintain? and (b) is innovation really as unpredictable as many believe? His model was built from close observation of the disk drive, mechanical excavators, and integrated steel industries.
Management plays a key role in Christensen’s model of dynamic competition. The dilemma he saw was that “the logical, competent decisions of management that are critical to the success of their companies are also the reasons why they lose their positions of leadership.” 20 He remarked that:
“Disruptive technologies bring to a market a very different value proposition… generally disruptive technologies underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have other features that a few (and generally new) customers value. Products based on disruptive technology are typically cheaper, simpler, smaller, and frequently more convenient to use.” 21
He noted that some companies tend to offer customers more than they would prefer to pay for. This overkill opens opportunities for new entrants to enter with lower price and quality products, and then improve their performance in a manner that undermines the incumbent.
His model is akin to Schumpeter’s, and it provides insights into some of the mechanisms of Schumpeter’s creative destruction. Christensen showed that incumbent firms often fail to respond to competition from new entrants with low priced or quality products because doing so would cannibalize existing revenue and profit streams. Christensen, however, underplayed high end disruption i.e., some new entrants come in with high price points and migrate to lower prices, the opposite of Christensen’s bottom up entry narrative. And whereas Kenneth Arrow assumed impenetrable entry barriers shielding a patent monopolist22, Christensen pointed to the soft “underbelly” of incumbents because of the cognitive blind spots of the incumbent’s top management team. New entrants are not saddled with conventional managerial wisdom, established value networks, or existing technological performance trajectories to follow. That is why they often overturn the incumbents.
Interestingly, some version of the above are commonplace understanding in the field of (technology) management. These regularities appear to turn the standard model of static competition and industrial organization on its head. While established competition policy analysis tends to treat incumbency as a benefit, the (technology) management literature more often considers incumbency as a liability.
It should be noted that the (industrial) economics that informs competition policy puts far too much weight on incentives as an explanation for everything. While incentives are critical, they are not the only consideration that drives outcomes with respect to investment, pricing, output levels, etc. One can have heavy incentives to engage in certain actions and behaviors; but incentives alone do not dictate outcomes. Capabilities matter too, and these are shaped by the resources and assets at the disposal of the enterprise, as well as by an organization’s history, its business model, and its strategy. These are among the considerations agencies must begin to examine.
At their core, many popular and accepted strategic management models embody a number of assumptions and propositions that are characteristic of dynamic competition. Some are rooted in evolutionary theory. And most accept some version of an organizational capability theory of economic change, along with a behavioral theory of the firm. These models and others like them can no longer continue to be ignored by so many competition policy scholars and agency employees.
 
III. ENTER EVOLUTIONARY, COMPLEXITY, AND CAPABILITY ECONOMICS
Dynamic competition implicitly rests upon a theory of the innovating firm which is markedly different from the simple microeconomic models of firms which populate introductory, intermediate, and advanced economic textbooks. Textbook theories caricature the business enterprise as we know it. In this section we explore whether research in evolutionary economics and strategic management can help fill the void that exists (in the field of industrial organization/antitrust economics) with respect to the theory of the firm and its likely future evolution. Such a framework is necessary if one is to have any hope of doing meaningful “but for” or counterfactual analysis to assess potential and nascent competition, identify potential competitors, and otherwise give substance to a dynamic competition framework where innovation is the driver of competition, and where efficiency must take a back seat to efficacy.
A. Evolutionary (and Complexity) Economics23
Concepts of competition are fundamental to both ecology and economics.24 Notwithstanding, members of species sometimes cooperate in competing with other species e.g., killer whales herding seals in preparation for a kill. Meanwhile, the traditional economic view (e.g., Stigler) stresses rivalry, not cooperation. Nicholas Kaldor25 and Teece26,27 among others have stressed the importance of cooperation and complementarities to the competitive process, and to innovation in particular.
Ecological theory is, however, not a perfect guide. It is perhaps better to think of the business organization not as a biological system evolving naturally, but as an economic entity guided and shaped by management, what one might call “evolution with design.” Evolutionary processes are the “blind” result of past events, not necessarily making species/organizations well suited for the future.
What makes an organization well suited for the future is not just its evolving ordinary capabilities, but also its dynamic capabilities, i.e., the ability to sense, seize, and transform and to shape the business environment, and not just be shaped by it.
With the above in mind, and as already noted, the basic notion of the advantage of incumbency in industrial economics must be turned on its head in many circumstances. The business firms that have been successful in the past are not necessarily best suited for the future where the business environment will be different. Indeed, with digital transformation, quite the opposite is likely to be true. So those that have survived today are not necessarily the fittest for the future, even if they are the fittest for the moment. Whether they stay fit depends very little on market structure and market power.  It may not even depend that much on organization structure. However, it can depend critically on their (entrepreneurial) management, or lack thereof.
In biology, evolution is closely linked to reproduction and continuation. However, this is not necessarily so in business and economics, especially since business environments change much more rapidly than biological ones. The fittest in an evolutionary sense need not be the most efficient (optimizing a particular subgoal) but those balancing being fit for the present and being fit for the future. This balancing act requires strong dynamic capabilities. As the biologist Marian S. Dawkins notes “an animal that gathers food optimally… is so intent on feeding that it gets eaten by a predator.”28
Optimality and efficiency are the concern of (static) competition; innovation and change are the focus of dynamic competition. Thus, evolutionary economics along with complexity economics29 eschews a single-minded focus on market equilibrium in economies and refocuses instead on dynamic processes (that include irreversibilities) that effectuate economic change. Dynamic processes emerge from actions by diverse agents that are boundedly rational, and who learn from experience. Firms are guided by their past and by entrepreneurial leaders, not by internal shadow prices.30 Market structure has little to do with outcomes.31
B. The Capabilities Perspective 
Evolutionary and complexity economics has significant overlap with the capabilities perspective. The capabilities perspective improves  the explanatory and predictive power of evolutionary and complexity theories by making these approaches more operational. Capability theory respects basic principles from evolutionary and complexity theories while at the same time recognizing the role of management (and boards of directors), business models, and strategy. Evolutionary thinking has been influential in strategic management and has helped undergird the dynamic capabilities framework, particularly in its first iteration.32,33 In that early version, the capabilities perspective focused on the role of history in shaping the degree to which a firm can reconfigure its assets. Recognition depends on asset redeployment and managements ability to orchestrate assets. It’s not just about incentives. Capabilities matter, and they can be either strong or weak; and a firm’s “evolutionary path … is often rather narrow” 34 particularly if it has strong ordinary capabilities… but weak dynamic capabilities.
Note that the accepted definition of dynamic capabilities (“an organization’s ability to achieve new and innovative forms of competitive advantage given path dependencies and market positions”) stresses the need to “integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments” (italics added).35 This has important ramification for M&A policy as it indicates the importance of strategic alliances and M&A activity to the maintenance of firm level competitive advantage, and hence to dynamic competition.
The dynamic capabilities framework recognizes that some firms can effectuate discontinuous organizational transformations.36,37 Entrepreneurial managers can search not just locally but widely for new opportunities and introduce routines more distant from existing ones than are typically contemplated in the evolutionary literature. Call it evolution with design — or even better, evolution with design, purpose, and strategy. Such (entrepreneurial) managerial behavior is the engine of dynamic competition. Figure 1 summarizes some key parameters that impact the speed and difficulty of change.38
Figure 1. Three dimensions of “distance” impacting enterprise transformation
The trade-off between the cost and speed of change can be mitigated to some extent by advanced preparation in the form of creating a culture of innovation and resilience. An open, agile culture cannot be created overnight. Like absorptive capacity, it builds over time and lowers the cost – and expands the range – of future strategic choices.39 Imposition of radical change in an organization that is not suitably prepared is likely to create problems that can potentially undermine strategic renewal.40
Dynamic capabilities animate dynamic competition. The key clusters of activities that constitute dynamic capabilities can be categorized as sensing, seizing, and transforming.41,42 See Figure 2.43 These activities are the domain of the organization, under the guidance of top management and boards of directors. This highlights the fact that the actions and behaviors of management and boards can no longer be ignored. If competition policy is to embrace dynamic competition, it will now have to review the action and proclivities of management teams and boards of directors.
Figure 2. Foundations of dynamic capabilities and business performance
Sensing, in the dynamic capabilities context, is the ability, under Knightian uncertainty, to either recognize opportunities before they are fully apparent or, in some cases, create new ones.44 While there are underlying routines, the signals that feed into them should come from near and far, leaving it to the relevant decision maker(s) to make sense from them, as a prelude to making strategy.
In the dynamic capabilities framework, seizing involves execution. That in turn involves the implementation of business models, the orchestration of assets including data, the achievement of strategic alignment, and the setting of firm boundaries, and the making of investment commitments.45
Dynamic capabilities allows and requires proactive managers to effectuate organizational transformation in anticipation of environmental change, not waiting to adapt to changes after they occur. The development of firms is not by any means completely path dependent or limited to best-practice or equifinal routines. Instead, distinctive, higher-order routines, rules of thumb, and/or managerial approaches lead to distinctive evolutionary paths. Excellence not only in search (“sensing” in dynamic capabilities terms) but also in sensemaking (Teece, 1998) affords the firm the opportunity to stay ahead of competitors and to animate dynamic competition in multisided marketplaces. When other factors are not decisive, the dynamic capabilities of the top management team may need to come into focus in the merger review process. Antitrust/competition  economics needs to embrace capability considerations, difficult as this may be. The headlong rush to learn and apply platform economics will fall very short if its not coupled to an understanding of capabilities, how they develop, how they evolve, and how they matter.
 
IV. THE POTENTIAL COMPETITION DOCTRINE AND ITS (LIMITED) EVOLUTION
A. Introduction
The UK CMA notes that “unilateral effects may also rise from the elimination of potential or dynamic competition.”46 It goes on to note that “existing firms and potential complementors can interact in an ongoing competitive process, and a merger could lead to the loss of dynamic competition.”
Antitrust analysis in the tech sector has struggled for almost a century to develop a robust theory of potential competition and it is encouraging to see the CMA grapple with the problem. It has become an important topic because of allegations that some competition agencies have allowed mergers of companies that were nascent or potential competitors that could have become actual competitors to established platforms. Of course, if one accepts the notion… and I do not… that path dependency and first move advantages lead inexorably to dominance… at least once the market has tipped… then there is little value to preserving the independence of a potential competitor, at least not post any supposed tipping point. The reason is that it would be irrelevant as nothing could stop the incumbent platform juggernaut. However, the notion of inexorable dominance is not empirically valid in the platform economy as Evans & Schmalensee47 and others have demonstrated; so potential competition can still be effective. In the context of platforms, this means that new entrants/small firms can siphon off users; it also means that their very presence can help condition the behavior of incumbents.
In the United States, Clayton Act Section 7 applies not only to mergers between actual competitors, but also mergers with potential competitors. This is true especially when there are few or no other potential competitors “waiting in the wings.” With the 2010 U.S. merger guidelines, it was recognized that mergers between potential competitors raise horizontal, not conglomerate concerns. The guidelines recognize that if there are plenty of potential competitors waiting in the wings, the elimination through mergers of one such competitor is of no moment.
As noted, there has been almost no development or advances for a century to the theory of potential competition despite the obvious importance of the topic, not just to entry analysis but to the understanding of new enterprise development. The topic is poorly developed because the field of economics ignores the capabilities of firms (or assumes they are all the same… though perhaps they may have different costs and likely future trajectories of development). Neoclassical Economists prefer to frame the impact of potential competition merely in terms of limit pricing. This is very much an industrial age perspective and a highly stylized and very limited view of potential competition that once again ignores innovation and disruption. Furthermore, it ignores the capabilities of individual firms… both incumbents and new entrants.
The capabilities of firms are clearly relevant to the assessment of potential competition but as noted are generally ignored. A firm specific inquiry is required. The OECD’s assessment of the status quo is that: “Competition agencies do not know the probabilities, nor the possible actions.” The agencies nevertheless somehow supposedly make an assessment. Hopefully they look at internal documents, but without some type of framework for assessing capabilities, it is hard to image that any kind of sound analysis takes place.
What is required is a framework for counterfactual analysis: but for the merger, would a potential competitor emerge and enhance competition in the industry? The fundamental question to answer is “What is the strength of the competitive threat that the nascent rival would pose?” To answer this question, a new set of concepts and tools are needed, and this is the focus of much of the rest of the paper. The analysis is done from a dynamic competition perspective.
B. Current State of Play on Potential Competition
The long and short of it is that the potential competition doctrine is hollow, and the courts have not put weight on it. Competition economists have not yet been able to put substance into it. Looking just at the incentives that a rational new enterprise faces is insufficient. Capabilities and their likely future evolution matter. The absence of such considerations in the theory of potential competition is not the result of Chicago School economics, as some might claim, but of the dominance of static (neoclassical) economics in which the firm is still largely a black box.
Being bereft of any helpful theories, courts have quite sensibly generally tried to conduct factually oriented inquiries concerning whether firms had the ability and incentive to enter a market. They have tended to look at (1) competition in a relevant market and trends (2) business attributes of the alleged potential entrants and (3) decisions and actions that the identified potential entrant has taken in the recent past. The focus is very rarely (perhaps never?) an investigation of the attributes of the potential competitor nor an assessment of the likely evolutionary path of the business or of the development of their capabilities. This is not because such an assessment is irrelevant. Rather, it is because it is difficult. There is no help from mainstream economic theory and few academic or agency economists have studied the business and managerial literature where important clues can be found.
A new and better approach would require assessing the organizational capabilities of the potential competitor along with its financial wherewithal and the basic economics at work (e.g., scale, scope, and network effects). These issues are important enough that the enforcement agencies and competition policy scholars must now begin to rise to this challenge.
 
V. OPERATIONALIZING A DYNAMIC COMPETITION/DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES PERSPECTIVE FOR ASSESSING POTENTIAL COMPETITION AND PLATFORM MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS
In general, technology driven businesses and marketplaces are fundamentally different from low tech companies. The rate of technological and organization change is high, and entry is common. Capabilities can be augmented through R&D and through acquisition. Data lakes and data pools often matter a great deal.48
A. Relevance of Big Data Orchestration Capabilities
Platform mergers and acquisitions are often driven by the ability of a platform leader to bring deep data orchestration capabilities to other circumstances. Economics of scale and network effects are also important considerations. All three together along with strong dynamic capabilities are needed to create winner-take-most situations. With access to data and advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, user/customer data stored, analyzed, and combined and recombined can be used to enhance services and provide more tailored or personalized services, and better matched services to other users on the platform. In economic terms, these technologies help enhance economies of scope. As I noted elsewhere,49 in order to be able to access economies of scope, integration (i.e., common ownership) is sometimes required. If contractual arrangements are possible, and the target entity is otherwise viable, a strategic alliance may suffice.
However data driven economies of scope are obtained, they enrich platform ecosystems because they enable further platform expansion. Insights gleaned can be utilized horizontally (in adjacent markets) and vertically. With respect to horizontal, it can enable “broad spectrum competition” i.e., projection into complementary marketplaces. With respect to vertical issues, data can be used to compete with upstream producers. As Parker and Van Alstyne  note, “mobile operating platforms have entered lucrative upstream applications such as music streaming, mapping, news provision, and fitness. Amazon frequently enters the markets of its suppliers.” 50(p3)
Network economies and economies of scope mentioned above are also augmented in the platform context by economies of scale because of the fixed cost nature of information services. The marginal cost of supplying another customer is often close to zero, once the digital goods are created. These three potential economies can advantage established platforms, but only so long as they are adept at managing the platforms and the associated business.
B. The Blurring of Structural Distinctions51
Structural analysis still matters in the digital economy; but it is no longer just market structure. A structural analysis of digital markets is incomplete without both an analysis of all the structures (e.g., ecosystems, markets, institutions) and capabilities that matter.
In digital industries, products that are imperfect substitutes or complements often compete against each other dynamically for user demand.52 Much anecdotal and empirical evidence shows that competitive pressure arises from non-substitute products, services, and business models that modify the relative preferences of users, raise the opportunity cost of present product consumption, and shift the demand curve for existing products inward. For example, users experienced lower relative utility from consumption of (i) desktop computers with the introduction of mobile phones; (ii) web portals with the development of search engines; and (iii) comparison shopping websites with the growth of merchant platforms. Unfortunately, conventional market definition methods that focus on actual (static) patterns of user substitution between rival products tend to discount that potential (dynamic) constraint.
In short, not only are traditional distinctions between horizontal and vertical blurred in ecosystems; the distinction between complement and substitutes is also blurred, rendering typical competition analysis of very limited value. A misplaced focus on static patterns of substitution has been clearly in display in the EC Google Android decision. Here, the EC held that Google did not compete with Apple in smartphone operating systems (“OS”) on the ground – among other things – that Apple’s iOS was not licensed to third party OEMs. The EC market definition is inconsistent with historical evidence showing that Android entry stole smartphone users from Apple despite their distinct business models, and with contemporary evidence suggesting that both ecosystems compete for users by product differentiation on choice variables like privacy.53 The EC market definition in Google Android also leads to curious implications such as the idea that a merger between Apple and Google in smartphone OSs would be prima facie unproblematic, absent actual horizontal overlaps.
The problems of static market definition might be mitigated by a revamped doctrine of potential competition. The term “revamped” is used because the conventional assessment of potential competition determines whether firms located in other markets or industries have incentives to repurpose assets to compete deploying close-to-perfect substitute products with established firms. In digital industries, firms compete by indirect entry.54,55 The dominant mode of competitive attack consists in supplying differentiated products,56 complements, or “new combinations.”57 In particular, competitive pressure might be exercised by products relying on different technological infrastructures or supported by distinct business models, or supplied through specialized vendors. Head-to-head entry with very similar products is often difficult, or even completely unwise. Non-rival competition is the rule, not the exception.
The reason for the greater ease of leveraging complements to produce competition than substitutes is easy enough to see. There are limited switching costs to complements on the user side. Users benefit from adding additional functionality to an existing product. By contrast, there are often switching costs to substitution on the user side due to the loss of sunk experience, learning, convenience, etc. (all the more when multi homing is not possible). A rational supplier thus quickly understands that there may be more short-term user surplus to extract from complements than substitutes.
Moreover, in the mid to long term, value can shift from the core product to the complement, as incremental improvements are introduced. A complement supplier can thus adopt a two-stage strategy that consists in breaking first the entry barrier of an ecosystem with a complement, and then attacking the insulating barrier that protects the core product. The end game may be one in which all the value is siphoned away from the core product. Accordingly, one should view ecosystem competition from a 360° perspective. There are a certain amount of rents. Competition is vertical, lateral, and horizontal. Competition is for rents, not users, per se. Through this lens complementors compete along with direct competitors.
With this in mind, the correct approach to potential competition and entry analysis more generally consists in putting more weight on Schumpeterian factors that keep nominal “monopolies” under competitive pressure. This has two consequences, one on market definition, the other on potential competition predictors. To start, because technological competition requires a longer time period to unfold than price competition, the boundaries of any market assessment must comprise all entrants with a potential entry path over a 4-year period (when applying the SSNIP test58). In assessing products and services that are likely to gain traction in the next few years, one must look beyond the traditional domain of substitutes  and examine new services which might leverage complements or entirely new technologies. Market definition is no more than a tool, a method, and is not always a necessary step. As one court noted, “A market definition should ‘recognize competition where, in fact, competition exists,’ and should include all significant competition even though that competition differs in form or nature.”59
Second, potential competition should not focus just on supply side substitution possibilities, but on technology “peers.” The inquiry should in particular focus on the magnitude of the technological capabilities of competitive peers, the disciplinary effects of the R&D programs of competitive peers even if new products are not yet in the market, and the magnitude of other competitive peer’s  time horizon and cost of capital.
C. Ecosystems (versus Relevant Markets) as Linchpin of an Operational Dynamic Competition Framework
I now turn to the difficult task of assessing capabilities and the viability of entry by a firm not currently a competitor, but which might nevertheless be (provisionally) thought of as a potential competitor.
It is sometimes alleged that incumbent (pharmaceutical) firms acquire innovative targets with the goal of shutting down their innovation projects and preempt future competition leading to “killer acquisitions.”60 One study showed that acquired drug projects are less likely to be developed after being acquired.
The comparison with pharma is quite inapposite. The nature of competition is quite different with technology platforms and there is far less clarity as to the evolutionary path of a technology firm. With the FDA process, it is very transparent to incumbent pharma companies what the potential new entrant will be putting into the market.  
In the context of platforms, competition can no longer be meaningfully assessed with the help of relevant (antitrust) markets. This is not only because multiple markets may be implicated (in the context of n-sided markets) but also because platform business models often result in certain sides being provided “free” (e.g., Google search) while other sides pay.  In the case of search, it is the advertisers. The various sides are of course deeply interconnected, upsetting traditional market analysis. Furthermore, the innovation that takes place and the dynamic competition that results is not just the result of the efforts of the platform owner/leader/conductor, but is also of the results of the efforts of many third parties such as app developers. Hence, adopting dynamic competition as the standard requires that one focus on the health of the ecosystem.
An ecosystem enables complementary products and services through collaboration with other companies or business units. Uber began with ride sharing but then added Uber Eats, Uber Health, Uber, and Jump Bike. Ecosystem expansion benefits both providers and consumers as it is more convenient to order services on a platform. With ecosystems, data is often shared between the platform leader/conductor and ecosystem partners. In strong ecosystems, partners do not just transact; they interact. Data is sometimes shared even beyond the ecosystem to external partners that can help improve the customer experience. 61
With ecosystems, standard upstream/downstream distinctions blur. As Parker and Van Alstyne note, “users create value for other users, as in the case of user generated content, and suppliers create value for other suppliers as in the case of shared developer files.” 62
A fundamental question which can help guide competition policy is to ask whether the merger/acquisition improves the health/robustness of the ecosystem by augmenting the business/technology/skillset of another ecosystem member/participant. Even if it is the dominant ecosystem which is doing the acquiring, having it improved with respect to innovation and expansion will help all constituencies in the ecosystem, unless the ecosystem leader extracts “too much” of the rents. In assessing this question, it is necessary to ask whether the rents at issue are Schumpeterian, Ricardian, or pure monopoly (Hicksian). This is a conceptual distinction made by Teece and Coleman and now needs to be operationalized.63   If value capture goes beyond Schumpeterian and Ricardian, it may weaken the ecosystem. Accordingly, it is somewhat important to have assurances with respect to the stewardship of the ecosystem; and with respect to an established platform, that is best assessed by examining the past stewardship (or lack thereof) behavior of the platform owner/leader/conductor.
Thus, a prelude to assessing the impact of M&A transactions on innovation and competition, one must ask whether the ecosystem will be harmed… harmed in the sense of reduced innovation, and/or whether the experience of users (convenience, choice, etc.) is compromised, or whether the opportunity for complementors to add complementary services is impaired in some way.
D. Distorting or Improving the Allocation of Venture Capital?
Various theories have also been raised about how M&A activities impact the venture capital funding of new entrants. The availability of lucrative exits conditions the flow of venture capital and stimulates the availability of funds and advice for new enterprise development in the ecosystem. On the other hand, platform leaders can also “hollow out” startups through predatory behavior of one kind or another, including certain types of acquisitions… particularly ones that simply shut down the new technology… or just put it on the shelf.
Yet another argument lurks in the background. It is the argument that even if the incumbent platform does not undertake any traditional anti-competitive actions, the reduction in prospective payoffs to entrants creates a “kill zone” where entry is hard to finance because the upside is somehow taken away by technology acquisitions.64 The claim is  that market entry rates and the supply of venture funds… decline in what is the “target” or kill zone for the platforms. A popular narrative is that once the big tech firm has made one such acquisition, it is unlikely to make another. Some claim evidence a “drop off” in venture capital investments in startups in sectors where Facebook and Google make major acquisitions. The implicit accusation in this narrative is that the founders’ discount rate is too high, due to a variety of factors. Systemic underpricing of IPOs is one of them. Taxation also plays a role. Big tech incumbents’ market power might be yet another factor.
Tim Wu has amplified this killer app narrative with his use of the “Kronos effect,” which supposedly hurts innovation, efficiency, openness, and decentralization.65 However, without a theory of dynamic competition, it’s not clear that Wu’s prescription of “overregulation” to prevent practically all M&A makes any sense whatsoever. Wu believes that AT&T pre the 1984 divestiture was suppressing innovation when it was, in fact, actively driving it with tremendous innovation stemming from Bell Labs. His account is lopsided there, and is likely wrong elsewhere.
None of these theories carry much weight unless combined with an assessment of the “but for” likely growth trajectory of the target potential competitor. Needless to say, this is a difficult challenge that even venture capitalists and management teams often have difficulty fathoming. However, it’s not an impossible task; but error must be accepted as likely. Enforcement agencies can no longer shy away from it; it will undoubtedly take time to develop expertise, and some form of burden shifting in the analysis may well be required, at least initially.
  
VI. SOME SPECIFIC CRITERIA AS APPLIED TO ASSESSING M&A
Competition is a means to an end; it is not the end in and of itself. This is particularly true in the platform context. Evolutionary, capability, and complexity economics teaches us that equilibrium analysis is likely highly misleading, suggesting that a good deal of standard antitrust economics needs to be thought about much more carefully. Mergers and acquisitions are an inevitable part of asset orchestration, which is enabled by M&A. M&A is not primarily about efficiencies but about innovation and capability enhancement. The language of efficiency needs to be expunged in the context of innovation. Innovation and (static) efficiency are usually at odds with each other.66
The fundamental question to ask when assessing an acquisition is whether it will harm dynamic competition (and innovation) within and across ecosystems. The answer to this can be illuminated by recognizing that:

The ecosystem (not the “relevant market”) should be the domain of inquiry;
Efficiency is decidedly secondary; innovation ought be the primary welfare criterion. 67
If there are multiple sides to the platform, benefits to all sides should be evaluated; and because pricing is not the only parameter that constituents care about, then access to services, integration of services, value of services and efficiency of ads, etc. should also receive limelight. This is necessary because horizontal and vertical distinctions are blurred anyway. In assessing the market power of Big Tech, recognize that they all compete across traditional (relevant) market boundaries; so traditional HHI market thresholds are meaningless.
Distinctions between vertical and horizontal markets are no longer meaningful as lateral firms (complementors) can become competitors too, and they must be assessed when calibrating the strength of potential competition.
Enquiry is necessary into whether the acquired entity be (i) shut down (ii) left alone (iii) integrated All but (i) are good. After an M&A transaction, capabilities are not lost to the ecosystem (assuming no shut down). If the acquired entity remains in the ecosystem, and is better integrated into the platform, it likely makes the ecosystem more robust and competitive. If multihoming exists prior to acquisition, will it continue post acquisition?
The higher the degree of alignment between the acquiring firm and the target, the greater the scope for benefits. Capabilities are more easily integrated when they are similar. The younger the target, the more malleable and more easily it is likely to be integrated, thereby improving the performance of the ecosystem.
If the platform leader/conductor is the acquirer, what is their track record with respect to nurturing innovation in the ecosystem. If it has a good track record, that helps. If it buys companies and snuffs them out, the agencies are entitled to be skeptical. If it predates against competitors, that is not good. Does it respect other companies’ (startups) intellectual property rights or not? Since intellectual property is an important way for new entrants to compete with incumbents, this is an important consideration. While static analysis (in principal) pays little or no attention to history, evolutionary approaches recognizes that “history matters.”
In the case of mergers and acquisitions of new entrants, consideration ought to be given to the unique positioning of the target and the positioning of other potential entrants too. However, uniqueness should not be overplayed, unless it is a firm that has been around a while, because new enterprises can pivot.68 Most startups pivot several times before they find their footing. And often, even after they find their footing. As recognized by the dynamic capabilities framework, the key lies in recognizing when it is time to pivot. History matters, but it is not determinative.
Since conventional structural analysis is not meaningful, the analysis of competitive effects is still the way to go… but we must get more flexible about it and introduce ecosystem robustness as the key metric by which to assess competitive effects. Reversions to yesterday’s structural thresholds is not the way out. Nor is the trotting out the analysis of traditional competitive effects (price and output) all that meaningful anymore.
Diversification via M&A that builds upon or extends existing capabilities is a form of diversification that a capabilities-based competition policy would view as meritorious.69,70,71 Missing capabilities can often be remedied by M&A activity; blanket prohibitions in mergers are therefore likely damaging to innovation.

 
VII. THE GIPHY ACQUISITION – HARMING DYNAMIC COMPETITION?
An issue that the CMA is actively considering is whether Giphy was or would (or could) become a realistic potential and/or actual competitor to Facebook with respect to display advertising. 72The concern is that the removal through merger of such a competitor (removal from the markets as an independent entity but not from the Facebook or other ecosystems) would harm dynamic competition. 
To assess “competitive effects” it is useful to focus on “innovation effects” as a surrogate. To do so, we must also consider the role of Giphy in the Facebook ecosystem. If it remains in the ecosystem… even if under the control of Facebook… then if it is still innovating, it is still impacting competition and generating consumer benefits, and it is even possible that Giphy could continue to bring competition to other parts of Facebook, although its ability to do so would be at the discretion of Facebook management.
Giphy is an online database and search engine that allows users to search for and share short looping and sometimes loopy videos with no sound.  It was founded in February 2013 as a website with a search engine. By August 2013 it had expanded beyond a search engine to allow users to post, embed, and share Graphics Interchange Format (“GIF”) digital images on Facebook and other services. Users can search the Giphy website using keywords to choose a GIF from among displayed search results. More commonly, however, services like Facebook, Snapchat, and text messaging allow users to add GIFs, including GIFs provided by Giphy via the Giphy APIs.
Giphy was recognized as a top 100 website in 2013 by PC magazine. Three months later, it also integrated with Twitter. Access to Giphy GIFs is often embedded in apps, allowing users to instantly find and share the right GIF. Giphy is now broadly integrated into other products and services, including on the iOS keyboard. The purchase by Facebook in 2020 was reported at about $400m, whereas the last venture money was raised at $600M. Ownership of Giphy by Facebook enables it to enhance its user engagement.
Before the Facebook acquisition, Giphy was a leading search engine for 6-second videos, but Giphy had and has direct competitors such as Tenor. Tenor was purchased by Google in 2018. At the time, users were searching for GIFs on Tenor’s keyboard 12 billion times per month.73 Other competitors include Gfycat, Imgur, Holler, and Vlispy. There is also a recent entrant – Heypster.
Whereas Giphy was started with 15000 GIFs but now has more than 1 billion; it also has several hundred million daily users via its website and API access from other services. However, its business model was not proven at the time of the Facebook acquisition. One can define a business model as follows:
“A business model articulates the logic and provides data and other evidence that demonstrates how a business creates and delivers value to customers. It also outlines the architecture of revenues, costs, and profits associated with the business enterprise delivering that value.”74
It appears from a distance that none of these elements had been well thought out and properly developed/implemented by Giphy.
At the time of the Facebook acquisition, the 7-year-old company had raised over $150.9 million in venture capital, but it still had a rather clumsy and unproven advertising model. It would host GIFs for brands and let them pay to promote them in search returns. This generated a very modest (experimental level) income from advertising.75
Giphy apparently tried to line up licensing deals with media producers and music companies to become a content distribution company. This approach to monetize its services was not sufficient to develop a robust business for Giphy. The fundamental business model problem the company struggled with, but never solved, lay in using someone else’s original content. Such usage undermines a copyright owner’s ability to control derivatives of their work, and where and how their work is shared, and their right to receive proceeds. This does not impact individuals, but it is an issue where commercial use is concerned. Furthermore, Giphy was not positioned to monetize its services through consumer use or providing advertising to its users. Though its search engine may have hundreds of millions of daily uses, these are mostly through users of other services accessing GIFs through Giphy’s APIs. When accessed via Giphy’s APIs, the users are not Giphy customers, but rather are customers of Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, or the other services being utilized by the consumer. Giphy may know little about its individual users,76 and it is difficult for a provider like Giphy to monetize its service when users are not its customers and it knows little or nothing about them. In addition, users add GIFs to pictures to personalize them and do not expect to see advertisements within their personal messages.77
Social media platforms like Giphy and Facebook develop services they hope will attract a critical mass of users. They then seek to attract a second ‘side’ to the platform… usually advertisers. Advertisers pay to display ads to those users. A large user base and resulting attention from advertisers also spurs activity on a third side i.e., content publisher, who use the platform as a distribution system. Content publishers then share advertising revenue with the platform that steered the traffic. The user does not pay cash but provides attention to the platform and allows the platform to collect personal (behavior) data about the user that assists in selling advertising targeted to that user. Targeted advertising is a good thing… users find it informative. Because it serves results to users via other services that access its APIs, Giphy is not positioned to develop a second side to its platform.
In short, Giphy had a defective business model, and there was no easy way to repair the lacunae. It was a company that had not found its footing. It had very limited capabilities. Its only asset was a user base; but that was hardly a user base that could be used to take on Facebook. Its product was useful across multiple platforms, making it an asset that Facebook had used – Facebook represented a large fraction of Giphy’s overall traffic – and that traffic could grow.
In terms of effects analysis, Giphy’s performance pre-merger  did not establish that providing ads in GIFs was a viable substitute that would divert advertising business from Facebook. It is not enough to simply assert or hypothesize  that Giphy might be a potential competitor to Facebook.
A dynamic competition analysis would consider whether Giphy had a credible capability to develop a competing advertising business but-for its acquisition. In the absence of a viable advertising business model and a capability to develop an advertising business, an acquisition of Giphy by Facebook would not have the potential to harm advertising competition. Furthermore, Giphy’s acquisition will not likely harm dynamic competition if innovation in the ecosystem is not harmed by the acquisition. This would follow if: (a) there is plenty of existing competition and (b) there are other likely or possible competitors and (c) Giphy left alone would not be a viable competitor to Facebook (d) Giphy stays viable in the ecosystem, albeit as part of Facebook. Innovation overall benefits if Giphy remains active and innovating, and in competing entities like Google’s Tenor continues to innovate in response. In addition, it is not appropriate to consider a “but for” world where Giphy will be purchased by someone else unless there is clear evidence that there is an active and viable alternative purchaser.
Absent an acquisition, Giphy would most likely have failed, resulting in its potential future innovations being lost. It is not evident that there were other qualified bidders… or that any alternative buyer would have been able to maintain Giphy’s independent status, let alone grow its capabilities to be able to take on Facebook. In short , it is not enough for there to be an alternative buyer for Giphy. For Facebook’s acquisition of Giphy to harm dynamic competition, any alternative buyer must likely be able to enhance innovation employing Giphy’s assets more than Facebook could.
If the threshold to compete with Facebook is as low as Giphy, there are no doubt scores of companies that are equally qualified as potential competitors. Giphy’s products/services are still in the market; so there is likely an improvement in the user experience across all ecosystems/platforms.78 That improvement is maintained/sustained by the acquisition.
Put differently, for the competitive effects of the acquisition to be negative, Giphy would, in the “but for” world, have to have:

Found additional venture capital resources and designed and implemented a viable business model.
Pivoted to something quite different from what it was… at least with respect to its business model.
Developed a management team with the audacity and skills to not just survive, and grow nicely, but take Facebook head on.

There is not much information available publicly, so my assessment is highly provisional; but at a first glance the chances of (1), (2), and (3) were close to zero in my judgement. There was very little chance Giphy would become an advertising giant that could take on Facebook. Instead, Facebook’s acquisition of Giphy maintained Giphy’s assets and furthered its innovation in Facebook’s ecosystem, strengthening that ecosystem in competition with others; and via Giphy’s APIs, strengthening the ecosystems of other service providers as well.79
What is new and challenging with the dynamic competition paradigm is that we are going where competition economists haven’t gone before, and opening up the black box of the firm. By not taking up this challenge 50+ years ago, learning has not occurred. As a result, antitrust analysis is not only static. It is silent when it comes to understanding the essence of what makes a potential competitor a viable entrant. It is not appropriate to say that the Chicago School got it wrong, and that the Neo-Brandeisians have it right. What is needed is a new dynamic competition-based set of rules that would refashion the assessment of competitive effects in the manner indicated here.
 
VIII. CONCLUSION
A new science of innovation, entrepreneurship, and competition has been emerging for some time. Our knowledge of venture capital, entrepreneurship, enterprise capabilities, business models, innovation, and complex systems is such that we are now able to look inside the firm and gain insight. It is not just about understanding platforms and network effects. We must also renovate the potential competition doctrine by creating frameworks that require and enable us to understand and assess organizational capabilities. There is now a field of organization economics, and there are also vibrant literatures on innovation and strategic management. The work of economic historians is also relevant,80 as is the work on complexity economics cited earlier. Tapping into these literatures, integrating them, operationalizing them, and focusing them on competition policy issues will at minimum give economists and lawyers a better perspective on the Facebook-Giphy transaction and other M&A activity in the tech sector.

23 Certain branches of economics have influenced evolutionary theory. This is widely believed that the economist Malthus influenced Darwin’s “origins of the species” and the role of natural selection. Before reading Malthus, Darwin apparently believed that living things reproduced just enough individuals to keep population stable. With Malthus he came to understand that populations could breed beyond their means, leaving survivors and losers in the effort to exist. Darwin then understood that the variety he saw in the wild would leave some individuals better able to survive and reproduce.

45 Aspects of these activities can be found by reading between the lines of the evolutionary literature, but they are certainly not given the full attention they merit in terms of their strategic importance. More importantly, evolutionary economics gives too little attention to the dimension of time, particularly the urgency needed for effective seizing.

Facebook is holding on to its position that its social media company is no monopolist, according to a new court filing. The social media giant argues that the US Federal Trade Commission shouldn’t be allowed to go forward with an antitrust lawsuit against it, reported Yahoo News.  Facebook wrote that the FTC’s monopoly claims are mere “speculation”.
“[R]ather than plead facts that could show monopoly power, [FTC] relies on inapposite statistics and admitted assumptions to dress up conclusory speculation,” Facebook said in its reply brief filed Wednesday.
“The FTC still has not identified a single commercial actor, anywhere, that recognizes a PSNS market as defined, much less tracks PSNS usage in a way that might permit assessment of market shares,” the filing states. Additionally, the company goes on to say, “no plausible factual support exists” for the agency’s claim that it has power to raise prices or restrict output in the purported market.
The FTC’s high-profile case against Facebook represents one of the biggest challenges the government has brought against a tech company in decades, and is being closely watched as Washington aims to tackle Big Tech’s extensive market power, according to Yahoo. 
Officials are looking into whether Facebook research documents indicate that it might have violated a 2019 settlement with the agency over privacy concerns, for which the company paid a record $5 billion penalty, one of the peo...

Facebook asked a US court on Wednesday to dismiss with prejudice an antitrust lawsuit filed by the US Federal Trade Commission.
In its court filing, Facebook argued that the FTC had “no plausible factual support” for its claim that the company has the market clout to push up prices in the social network market. The social media giant also said the FTC failed to “plausibly establish” that Facebook acted illegally to protect a monopoly.

The FTC’s high-profile case against Facebook represents one of the biggest challenges the government has brought against a tech company in decades, and is being closely watched as Washington aims to tackle Big Tech’s extensive market power.
The FTC had originally sued Facebook during the Trump administration, and its complaint was rejected by the court. It filed an amended complaint in August, adding more detail on the accusation the social media company crushed or bought rivals and once again asking a judge to force the company to sell Instagram and WhatsApp.
The case is being tried by Judge James Boasberg of the US District Court for the District of Columbia.

327,"November 30, 2021",UK Watchdog Orders Facebook To Sell Giphy Over Competition Concerns,"


On Tuesday the UK’s competition regulator said that it has directed Facebook to sell social-media animated images company Giphy after determining that the deal could harm social-media users and UK advertisers.
The Competition and Markets Authority said that the social media platform’s acquisition of Giphy would reduce competition between social-media platforms and that the deal has already removed Giphy as a potential challenger in the display advertising market, in-line with its provisional findings issued in August.
Related: UK Fines Facebook $69M For Breaching Order During Giphy Probe
After consulting with interested business and organizations, along with assessing alternative solutions, it has concluded that its competition concerns can only be addressed by the company selling Giphy in its entirety to another buyer.
“By requiring Facebook to sell Giphy, we are protecting millions of social media users and promoting competition and innovation in digital advertising,” said Stuart McIntosh, chairman of the independent inquiry group carrying out the investigation.
Giphy allows users to search for, create and share animated images known as GIFs, which stands for graphics interchange format. When Facebook bought Giphy last year, the company said it planned to integrate it into Instagram and other apps.

The UK competition regulator is expected to block Meta Platforms’ acquisition of online GIF platform Giphy in the coming days, the Financial Times reported on Monday.
The Competition and Markets Authority is set to reverse the deal in what would be the first time the watchdog has reversed a Big Tech acquisition, the report said, citing individuals close to the matter.
Meta Platforms and the regulator did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters sent outside working hours.
The regulator had in October fined the U.S. social media giant Facebook, now Meta, 50.5 million pound ($67.35 million) for breaching an order that was imposed during an investigation into its purchase of the GIF platform, Giphy.
Facebook bought Giphy, a website for making and sharing animated images, or GIFs, in May last year to integrate it with its photo-sharing app, Instagram. The deal was then pegged at $400 million by Axios.

Facebook has offered remedies in a bid to secure EU antitrust approval for its acquisition of US customer service startup Kustomer, a European Commission filing showed.
Facebook, now Meta Platforms, submitted its package on Wednesday. The EU competition enforcer, which did not provide details of the remedies in line with its policy, extended its decision deadline to Jan. 28. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the offer or demand more.
The Commission has previously said the deal may hurt competition and reinforce the U.S. social media company’s power in online advertising.
Facebook has won unconditional clearance from regulators in the UK and Australia for the deal.

330,"May 2, 2022",EU Goes After Apple Over Restricting Payment Options,"


EU antitrust regulators charged Apple on Monday with restricting rivals’ access to its NFC chip technology in a move that could result in a hefty fine for the iPhone maker and force it to open its mobile payment system to competitors.
The European Commission said it had sent a charge sheet known as a statement of objections to Apple, detailing how the company had abused its dominant position in markets for mobile wallets on iOS devices.
“We have indications that Apple restricted third-party access to key technology necessary to develop rival mobile wallet solutions on Apple’s devices,” EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
“In our statement of objections, we preliminarily found that Apple may have restricted competition, to the benefit of its own solution Apple Pay,” she said.
Apple said it would continue to engage with the Commission.
“Apple Pay is only one of many options available to European consumers for making payments, and has ensured equal access to NFC while setting industry-leading standards for privacy and security,” the company said in a statement.
The Commission’s decision to send a charge sheet known as a statement of objections to Apple confirmed a Reuters story in October last year.

331,"April 28, 2022",Brussels May Soon Accuse Tech Giant Of Blocking Others Out Of Apple Pay,"


Apple is set to face fresh antitrust charges in Brussels next week over the way it restricts rivals from accessing its mobile payment system, as the EU sets up its latest challenge to the market power of the world’s most valuable company. 
The tech giant will be accused of breaking EU law in the way it operates Apple Pay, a payments system that operates on hundreds of millions of iPhone devices, according to four people with direct knowledge of the matter. The $2.5tn company would receive heavy fines worth up to 10 percent of global turnover if the charges are upheld. 
Investigators, led by the bloc’s powerful competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, will accuse Apple of unfairly blocking groups such as PayPal and leading banks from accessing its mobile wallet system. 
The move signals how the EU has become the centre of a global regulatory crackdown against Big Tech, with groups such as Google and Facebook having regularly been in the crosshairs of antitrust authorities in recent years. 
The case, which was opened in 2020, is one of many investigations opened in Brussels against Apple, which had not faced antitrust charges from the EU before last year. In two other cases, investigators are probing whether Apple is harming competition in the books and music streaming services within its App Store. 
The charges expected to be announced next week relate to the NFC — or “near field communication” — technology that allows a user to pay by tapping their iPhone on a payments terminal. That personal device is linked to debit or credit cards through a mobile wallet.

332,"April 26, 2022",Apple Beats Currency App Developer’s Antitrust Claims,"


Apple defeated claims for a second time in San Francisco federal court brought by the founder of Konverti, a peer-to-peer currency exchange app, who alleged its removal from the Apple App Store violated a California unfair competition law.
Thomas Reilly, Konverti’s founder, was unable to show Apple’s decision to remove the app weeks after it appeared in the store in 2017 constituted fraud or was anti-competitive behavior, Judge Edward M. Chen said Monday.
Chen, of the US District Court for the Northern District of California, had dismissed antitrust and unfair competition claims in January, but allowed Reilly to file an amended complaint, which only contained the latter claims.
Reilly argued that Apple was willfully deceptive by initially telling Konverti that it complied with App Store policies before reversing course and removing the app. Apple said the app was unsafe because it facilitated in-person meetings for currency exchanges and violated local laws in some locations. 
“The complaint includes vague allegations that someone at Apple represented to Plaintiff at an unidentified time” that the app complied with App Store policies, the judge said. “This ambiguous, nonspecific and general allegation does not satisfy” the fraud standard under the California unfair competition law, he said.
Chen said discovery wasn’t needed to identify Apple’s specific communications because that burden was on Reilly. 
The amended complaint contained a few additional details, including that Konverti was told it was compliant through the Apple Developer Program, but that still didn’t meet the specificity standard, the court said. 
Chen also said Reilly’s fraud theory fails because Konvarti couldn’t reasonably rely on Apple’s statements that it complied with store policies when investing money into developing the app. There was also no evidence that Apple intended to induce Konvarti into relying on those statements, the judge said.
Apple’s guidelines include language that warns app developers that it is their responsibility to make sure an app complies with local laws, Chen said.

333,"April 21, 2022",Moscow Court Rules Antitrust Case Against Apple App Store Valid,"


A Moscow court on Thursday ruled that it was lawful for Russia’s anti-monopoly regulator to open an antitrust case against Apple over an App Store payment dispute, dismissing a case brought by the US company, the RIA news agency reported.
Russia began the antitrust case against Apple in October, accusing it of failing to allow app developers to tell customers about alternative payment options when using its App Store. It said Apple could face a fine based on its revenue in Russia if found guilty. 
Apple and Russia’s Federal Anti-monopoly Service (FAS) did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
RIA said the Moscow Arbitration Court had dismissed Apple’s case in its entirety. It said the decision can be appealed.
Separately, law firm Chernyshov, Lukoyanov & Partners on Wednesday said it was preparing a lawsuit against Apple for what it said was a violation of Russian consumers’ rights after the company restricted the use of Apple Pay on March 1 in response to Russia sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The same law firm is behind a similar lawsuit against streaming company Netflix, which in March suspended its service in Russia and said it was temporarily stopping all future projects and acquisitions in the country.

334,"April 21, 2022","Apple, Amazon, Facebook Spend Big On Antitrust Lobbying","
Apple, Amazon and Meta spent record sums on federal lobbying through the first three months of the year as they fought bipartisan antitrust legislation, according to documents filed with Congress Wednesday night.
Apple spent more than $2.5 million on lobbying in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 71 percent from the same period last year. Meta spent nearly $5.4 million, up 13 percent from last year’s first quarter. Amazon shelled out nearly $5 million, a 4 percent increase.
The rise comes as the big four tech firms attempt to derail the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, a bill to prevent dominant digital platforms from favoring their own services and empower antitrust officials to more aggressively investigate tech giants.
Tech giants, along with tech-backed lobbying groups and former national security officials, have increasingly cited China and Russia in their effort to defeat the bill, claiming that the measure would strengthen U.S. adversaries by weakening the nation’s tech giants.
Apple and Google are leading the charge against the Open App Markets Act, which would block app stores from favoring their own apps in searches, requiring developers to use their payment systems and blocking users from using third-party app stores.  
Apple CEO Tim Cook has personally lobbied lawmakers to drop the latter measure and warned last week that it would “undermine privacy and security” of Apple users.
Google, whose CEO has also pushed back on the bill, spent nearly $3 million on lobbying in the first quarter, up 10 percent from the same period last year but down from previous years.

335,"April 12, 2022",Apple’s Tim Cook Speaks Out Against New Antitrust Legislation,"


Apple CEO Tim Cook warned in a speech at a Washington, DC, conference on Tuesday that antitrust legislation aimed at lessening the monopoly power of app stores could harm users, The Hill reported.
“We are deeply concerned about regulations that would undermine privacy and security in service of some other aim,” Cook said at the IAPP Global Privacy Summit.
“Here in Washington and elsewhere, policy makers are taking steps in the name of competition that would force Apple to let apps on the iPhone that circumvent the App Store through a process called ‘sideloading,’” he continued.
Apple has pushed back against letting iPhone users download products from third parties, or sideloading, in white papers and letters to Congress.
The company warns that doing so would open up users to spyware or malware infections.
“[Sideloading] means data hungry companies would be able to avoid our privacy rules and once again track our users against their will,” Cook said Tuesday. “It would also potentially give bad actors away around the comprehensive security protections we put in place, putting them in direct contact with our users.”
Proponents of legislation to force Apple to allow sideloading both in Washington and Europe argue that the company’s tight control over the App Store gives it a stranglehold over developers that it can exploit to charge exorbitant fees.
The bipartisan Open App Markets Act would enshrine the right to sideload and block Apple as well as Google from requiring developers to use their payment tools, helping make it easier for developers to distribute their apps and connect with their customers. The bill was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year but has yet to get a vote on the floor.
“Apple believes in competition,” Cook noted. “But if we are forced to lead unvetted apps on the iPhone, the unintended consequences will be profound.”

336,"April 11, 2022",Apple Music Streaming In EU Crosshairs,"


Apple is facing another antitrust charge in the European Union following a complaint about its practices by music subscription service Spotify.
As Reuters reported Monday (April 11), the European Commission last year accused the tech giant of hindering competition in the streaming music sector by imposing rules in its App Store that force developers to use Apple’s in-house payment system and keep them from telling customers about other payment options.

These requirements have been criticized by regulators in several other countries. This year has seen the Netherlands levy millions in fines against Apple for failing to comply with an order from last year to adjust the conditions in its App Store to let dating-app providers offer alternative methods of payment.
Apple and the EC had no comment on the new charges, Reuters said.
Under the EU’s recently passed Digital Markets Act (DMA), the types of practices Apple is accused of will become illegal. However Apple and other Big Tech firms have some time before the law goes into effect, Reuters noted.
“The DMA is still two years away. The rules will probably apply to Apple at the beginning of 2024. This is why antitrust cases remain important,” Damien Geradin, an attorney at Geradin Partners, who is advising a group of app developers in other cases against Apple, told Reuters.
Companies found to be in violation of EU antitrust laws can face fines of up to 10% of their turnover and orders to halt anti-competitive practices. Along with the music streaming investigation, Apple’s practices in eBooks and its Apple Pay are also subject to EU action.

337,"April 5, 2022",Epic Games’ Apple Australian Court Dates Moved To 2024,"


Proceedings in the legal dispute between Epic Games and Apple have bogged down in Australia, and won’t reach a courtroom until 2024.
A Monday ruling of the nation’s Federal Court decided that, as Google and Epic are also fighting over essentially the same issues, it makes no sense for Epic and Apple to air their grievances separately, as was planned for November 2022.
Epic and Apple had already told the court they would not be ready by November, which led Justice Nye Perram to push the hearing into 2023. Epic and Google, meanwhile, had told the court they would not be ready to front until late 2023 or early 2024.
Perram felt that assessment was optimistic, so has scheduled 18 weeks commencing in March 2024 to hear both cases.
But the judge is also worried that the cases will be very difficult to manage, because both address essentially the same issue: whether Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store lessen competition, as Epic alleges they did by excluding Epic’s game Fortnite after it bypassed their payment schemes. Perram therefore pondered that one case could resolve issues raised in the other.
“For example, if in the Apple case, Epic is found to be correct and that the iOS App Distribution Market consists of the provision of distribution services to the developers of apps on the iOS platform, then this necessarily implies that the App Store does not compete in relation to gaming with the Google Play Store,” he wrote. “Having made that finding, could it then be concluded in the Google case that the Android App Distribution Market is in fact a market of two-sided transaction platforms providing services to both consumers and developers and that the platforms compete with each other?”

338,"April 5, 2022",Apple In DMA’s Crosshairs Over Payments,"


Apple’s latest plan to develop its own payment processing system may test the limits of the recently approved European Digital Markets Act (DMA). 
According to Bloomberg sources, Apple is planning to bring some financial services in-house, including the development of its own payment processing system, but it could also add credit checks, risks assessment for loans, and other financial services.
This revelation comes just a few days after the European Union agreed on its final draft of the DMA. Apple’s project could raise some interesting questions about the way the new EU law is interpreted by authorities in what could become the first real-world test for the landmark legislation.
The DMA will impose new obligations and restrictions on gatekeepers, mostly Big Tech firms, by the end of this year. At this point, it is well known that some of these obligations will likely force Apple to provide access for third parties to alternative payment methods in the App Store, to share more information with app developers, or even to make iMessage work with competition messaging services.
Far less known, though, is the real scope of the DMA and how it is designed to address structural features of digital platforms, as well as future conduct that could prevent competition in certain markets.
For payments, in addition to the provisions that will compel Apple and Google to provide alternative payment methods to their own in the App Stores, the DMA establishes that gatekeepers that have a dual role as developers of operating systems and device manufacturers, namely Apple and Google, cannot impose restrictions to access certain functionalities in their devices to third parties, like near-field-communication technology (NFC). NFC chips are used for “tap and go” payments.
In paragraph 52, the DMA sets out the potential problem, “a gatekeeper that is a manufacturer of a device may restrict access to some of the functionalities in this device, such as near-field-communication technology and the software used to operate that technology, which may be required for the effective provision of an ancillary service by the gatekeeper as well as by any potential third-party provider of such an ancillary service.”
Read More: The EU’s Proposal for a Digital Markets Act – an Ex-Ante Landmark
And it continues with the solution if a gatekeeper engages in such practices, “the gatekeepers should therefore be obliged to ensure access under equal conditions to, and interoperability with, the same operating system, hardware or software features that are available or used in the provision of any ancillary services by the gatekeeper.”
These provisions are drafted using broad terms and it is yet to be seen how they will be interpreted in practice, but there is a risk that Apple and Google may need to provide access, not only to current rivals but also to “potential third-party providers,” to the software and hardware that they use to provide ancillary services.
Will a new payment processing system be an ancillary service? Will Apple be able to limit access to certain features if this access represents a risk to the integrity of the system? There aren’t straight answers and most likely regulators, judges and Apple will debate the limits of the DMA on these points.
 Apple may be considered a gatekeeper for certain core platform services, and this could enable third parties to request access to certain Apple functionalities. The European Commission is already investigating the NFC chip technology. The preliminary concerns were Apple’s refusal to allow rivals access to the payment system. 
The new DMA now could go one step further and prevent Apple from refusing access to third parties to software and hardware that could limit the provision of any ancillary service that Apple provides.

339,"March 31, 2022",Apple Explores In-House Payments Processing,"


Technology giant Apple is trying to bring more of its operations in-house, including developing its own payment processing tech and infrastructure that will run its future financial products, Bloomberg wrote on Wednesday (March 30).
The report noted that Apple’s idea is “ambitious,” citing sources familiar with the matter. It would reportedly cut down on the tech giant’s reliance on outside partners, eventually replacing most outside services over a multi-year plan.
This would come with new approaches to payment processing, risk assessment for lending, fraud analysis, credit checks and more, including things like dispute handling, per the report.
Rather than focusing on Apple’s current lineup of services, the plan seems to be focused on future products. Apple’s current push would also make the company a bigger force in financial services.
Bloomberg wrote that part of the project has been called “Breakout” in internal communications. Sources told the publication that the name highlights the idea of “breaking away” from the existing financial system, and the project is reportedly Apple’s biggest foray into finance.
This could be a hurdle to get over, with other tech companies — like Meta and Alphabet — having attempted similarly ambitious projects, only to scale them back later. In Meta’s case, that included its digital coin, and in Alphabet’s, its plan for bank accounts.
The company’s lineup already includes the Apple-branded credit card, peer-to-peer payments, the Wallet app and a mechanism for merchants to accept credit cards from an iPhone. 
Apple pioneered its payment system ApplePay in 2014, allowing multiple payment options for users of Apple devices. The company was criticized by regulators for its ‘walled garden’ approach that restricts the compatibility of third-party offerings.

340,"January 19, 2022",Microsoft-Activision Deal To Face Antitrust Scrutiny,"


Microsoft’s US$69 billion deal to buy video game powerhouse Activision Blizzard is expected to win out with regulators despite vows in Europe and the US to rein in tech titans, reported The Wall Street Journal.
Analysts interviewed by AFP after the merger plan was announced on Tuesday, January 18, said the deal would certainly be scrutinized, but likely less intensely than would an acquisition by Amazon, Google, or Facebook-parent Meta.
“From a regulatory perspective, Microsoft is not under the same level of scrutiny as other tech stalwarts,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella “saw a window to make a major bet on consumer while others are caught in the regulatory spotlight and could not go after an asset like this,” Ives added.
The analyst noted that there are bound to be some “speed bumps navigating both the Beltway and Brussels” given the epic size of the deal.

Microsoft is buying “Call of Duty” maker Activision Blizzard for US$68.7 billion in the biggest gaming industry deal in history as global technology giants stake their claims to a virtual future, reported Reuters.
The all-cash deal announced by Microsoft on Tuesday, January 18, its biggest-ever acquisition, will bolster its firepower in the booming videogaming market where it takes on leaders Tencent and Sony.
It also represents the American multinational’s bet on the “metaverse,” virtual online worlds where people can work, play, and socialize, as many of its biggest competitors are already doing.
“Gaming is the most dynamic and exciting category in entertainment across all platforms today and will play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said.
Microsoft’s offer of US$95 per share represents a premium of 45% to Activision’s Friday close. Its shares were up 27% at US$83.35 in early trading, still a steep discount to the offer price, reflecting concerns the deal could get stuck in regulators’ crosshairs.
Microsoft has so far avoided the type of scrutiny faced by Google and Facebook, but this deal, which would make it the world’s third largest gaming company, will put them on lawmakers’ radars, said Andre Barlow of the law firm Doyle, Barlow & Mazard.
“Microsoft is already big in gaming,” he said.

343,"December 22, 2021",EU OKs Microsoft’s $19.7B Nuance Purchase,"
A month after the European Commission opened an investigation into Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of transcription software developer Nuance Communications, the EU’s competition bureau determined that the $19.7 billion business combination wouldn’t pose a threat to antitrust regulations and doled out an unconditional all-clear to the transaction.
Regulators began looking into the purchase in November, after the companies submitted their proposal for review. At the time, per Reuters, E.U. authorities sent out questionnaires to clients and competitors of Microsoft and Nuance to ask whether they viewed the two companies as competitors and if they believed the merger would negatively impact their own businesses.
Once the preliminary probe had been launched, officials had until Dec. 21 to either extend the investigation or sign off on the acquisition. They ultimately settled on the latter, noting in a statement on Tuesday that “the commission found that the transaction, as notified, would not significantly reduce competition in the transcription software, cloud services, enterprise communication services, customer relationship management, productivity software and PC operating systems markets.”
The investigation focused on a handful of core concerns. The first of these, according to the statement, was the potential overlap between transcription software offered by both Nuance and Microsoft, though regulators concluded that Nuance’s out-of-the-box products—used largely by hospitals and other healthcare clients—are “very different” from the speech recognition capabilities available to users of Microsoft’s Azure Cognitive Services.

On Monday UK’s antitrust regulator said it will look into Microsoft’s  $16 billion purchase of artificial intelligence and speech technology firm Nuance Communications.
According to Reuters, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which has been stepping up its regulation of Big Tech, said it was considering if the deal would result in lesser competition in the UK market.
Microsoft announced it would buy Nuance in April to boost its presence in cloud services for healthcare. The deal has already received regulatory approval in the United States and Australia, without remedies given.

Reuters reported last week the deal, which will be Microsoft’s second biggest after its $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn in 2016, was set to secure unconditional EU antitrust approval.
Microsoft has also been in preliminary talks with the CMA ahead of a formal request for approval of the Nuance deal, the sources had said.
The transaction, which was expected to close this year, would be Microsoft’s second-largest deal, following the software giant’s $26 billion purchase of LinkedIn in 2016. Burlington, Massachusetts-based Nuance has about 7,100 employees, more than half of whom are outside the US.
British regulators have stepped up scrutiny of tech-related acquisitions. Last month, the competition authority ordered Facebook to undo its purchase of Giphy and sell off the GIF-sharing platform because it found the deal stifles competition for animated images and hurts social media users and advertisers.

The latest tech deal, Microsoft’s second biggest after its $26.2 billion LinkedIn purchase in 2016, follows heightened regulatory scrutiny of “killer acquisitions” whereby tech giants buy and shut down nascent start-ups and potential rivals.
Microsoft announced the Nuance deal, which would boost its presence in cloud services for healthcare, in April and it has already received regulatory approval in the United States and Australia, without remedies given.

EU’s antitrust regulator is taking a deeper look into Microsoft’s  $16 billion deal for transcription technology company Nuance Communications, asking customers and competitors to draw up a list of concerns, according to a questionnaire from last month seen by Reuters.
The previously unreported outreach is the most extensive by an antitrust authority since the companies announced the acquisition in April, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Microsoft declined to comment, and Nuance did not respond to a request for comment.
After minimal review, the US Departmentof Justice in June and the Australian Competition Commission in October said they would not contest the deal. The companies filed for approval from the European Commission’s competition bureau last month, and the regulator has until Dec. 21 to clear the deal or open a bigger investigation.
The companies had expected to close the deal by the end of this year, but said last month the timeline could slip to early next year.
The questionnaire asks whether Microsoft and Nuance are competitors and whether a tie-up could affect clients and rivals, including whether Microsoft could favor Nuance over competing services.

Google sent a letter to the DOJ requesting that the department examine whether newly confirmed antitrust division head Jonathan Kanter, who has been a vocal critic of the search giant, should be recused from federal antitrust investigations into Google.
In his new role, Kanter will lead the department’s lawsuit against Google alleging it has a monopoly in the search and advertising markets.
Kanter has represented a number of companies in motions against Google, which the search giant argues should disqualify him. Most notably, Kanter represented Microsoft in a motion arguing against Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick, which was eventually approved by regulators and was closed in 2008. Related: US Panel Approves Kanter To Justice Department Antitrust Division

349,"November 2, 2021",Microsoft Presents New Tech Updates To Allow Rivals Cloud Access,"


Microsoft announced a new round of technologies aimed at making its cloud computing services work in data centers it does not own – including the cloud data centers of its rivals.
The strategy, Microsoft executives and analysts say, has been key to the company’s rise in the cloud computing infrastructure market, which research firm Gartner estimates hit $64.3 billion and where Microsoft is second only to market leader Amazon.com’s Amazon Web Services. Microsoft said revenue from Azure, its flagship cloud offering, grew 48%, results that helped it overtake Apple  as the world’s most valuable publicly traded company.
Microsoft’s strategy has involved constructing its most lucrative cloud software services, such as database tools, so that they can run inside its own data centers, those owned by customers or even those of rivals like Amazon.
Microsoft’s cloud and artificial intelligence chief Scott Guthrie told Reuters that the move has persuaded some customers to use its services when they cannot always use Microsoft’s data centers. Royal Bank of Canada, Guthrie said, faces legal requirements to keep some of its computing work in its own data centers and uses a technology called Azure Arc to connect those facilities to Microsoft’s cloud.

Italy’s competition authority AGCM said on Thursday it had launched an investigation against Google for suspected abuse of its dominant position in data portability, an accusation the Alphabet unit denied.
The watchdog said in a statement that Google allegedly hindered interoperability with other platforms, particularly with Weople, an app by Italian operator Hoda, which could “constrain the economic benefits that consumers can derive from their data” and limit competition.
Giving such access, it said, would mean “putting people’s privacy at risk, as well as encouraging fraudulent activities. There are already ways for companies to increase direct portability of data in their services.”
Under Italian law, Google faces a fine of up to 10% of its annual global sales if found guilty of abusing its position.

South Africa’s Competition Commission, which has been probing online markets for the past 14 months, has provisionally found that Google’s search-engine practices distort competition in the company’s favor.
Paid-for results that typically appear at the top of a Google search should be prominently labeled as advertising and the top of the page reserved for results based on relevance only, the antitrust group said in a statement. 
The inquiry also recommended the U.S. giant — part of Alphabet Inc. — allows competitors to compete for prominence in a search by having their own specialist units and with no guaranteed positions for Google’s own products. It’s also exploring whether Google Search should remain the default position on South African mobile devices.
Google will review the report, and work “constructively” with the Competition Commission to answer their questions, the company said in an emailed response to questions.

Lawyers for Google questioned the DOJ’s and state plaintiffs’ bid to conduct new depositions of senior executives who have already spoken with government attorneys as part of their antitrust lawsuit over the tech companies’ search practices.
Google’s lawyers argued in a court filing in Washington, DC, federal court that the federal and state antitrust lawyers leading the case against the tech company had not justified their effort to open up new depositions.
The dispute marks a new flashpoint in the case, as the sides have quarreled for months over access to documents and other information. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday before US District Judge Amit Mehta.
The government said it wanted to speak again with, among others, Prabhakar Raghavan, senior vice president for Google search, and Philipp Schindler, chief business officer. Neither immediately responded to a request for comment on Wednesday.
The DOJ’s attorneys and lawyers for the states, including a team from the Colorado Attorney General’s office, said the new round of questioning was warranted because Google only recently turned over new documents that the company previously had said could be kept from the plaintiffs.
“Google improperly withheld thousands of documents under false claims of privilege,” DOJ attorney Kenneth Dintzer told the court in a new filing. “Google’s withholding of these documents was the culminating effort — following years of intentionally mislabeling documents — to hide significant information from civil discovery.”

354,"July 11, 2022",Google May Break Up $209B Ad-Tech Unit To Appease Regulators,"
As one of the most powerful companies in online searches and digital advertising, Google is accustomed to regulatory risks stemming from new legislation, antitrust probes or litigation. However, for the last few months, the company seems to have adopted a more collaborative approach with regulators and policymakers to manage, and eventually reduce, these regulatory risks. 
The latest example is the concessions offered by the company to the Department of Justice (DOJ) to fend off a possible U.S. antitrust lawsuit aimed at its ad-tech business, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
One of these commitments is a proposal to split off the part of its business that auctions and places ads on websites and apps, although the new entity would still be kept under the Alphabet umbrella. Google holds a strong position in most of the different parts of the ad-tech business, from the supply side to the demand side — and the marketplace where the orders from both sides are exchanged. However, it is unclear whether any commitment that falls short of selling part of the business to a third party would satisfy DOJ officials.  
DOJ could be readying a lawsuit against Google alleging that the company’s ad-tech practices are anticompetitive. This wouldn’t be the first time that the company has faced antitrust issues for its ad-tech business. In 2019, the U.K. Competition Market Authority (CMA) launched a market study in digital advertising, and it found that “competition in these markets was not working well.” The report showed that because of the position of Google (and Facebook) on the ad-tech chain, the market was not competitive, and prices were higher than could have been otherwise. As a result, the CMA recommended the government to pass new legislation to address this issue. 
In Europe, Google also faces another ad-tech investigation. The company also made an offer to settle the allegations that is using its strong position on YouTube to force advertisers to use Google’s ad-buying tools to access the video sharing platform. With its latest concessions, Google would allow competitors to access YouTube directly — but it didn’t offer to sell parts of the business to third parties. 
The ad-tech business is not the only area of the business where Google is offering concessions to defuse antitrust risks. For instance, on June 30 the company announced in its blog an agreement with a group of U.S. developers to avoid costly and lengthy litigation about terms and conditions of the Google Play Store, including the fees charged. Google not only offered economic relief as part of the settlement, but it also offered app developers more powers to reach customers and allowed developers to install other app stores in Android devices. 
The concessions in Europe and the U.S. show that the company may be willing to increase the scope of potential remedies to appease regulators and avoid lengthy antitrust probes and litigation.  
Offering concessions isn’t new for Google. It has done it in the past, even in the investigations that concluded with an antitrust fine. The difference, arguably, is that the company is now willing to offer a more comprehensive package to appease regulators and eventually avoid a probe or litigation where it is more difficult for Google to control the outcome and negotiate a remedy. 
Additionally, Google, as well as other Big Tech firms, is facing new antitrust bills that will regulate online platforms and limit to a certain extent some of their practices. In Europe, these bills were approved last week, and they may be fully implemented in 18 months. In the U.S., the proposed legislation is on the Senate, and it could be voted on soon.

According to Klobuchar, the bill has the 60 votes it needs to pass the Senate. However, the office of Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said it’s trying to still get the correct support for the bill in the Senate.
Per prior reports from CTFN, the decision for a floor vote for the bill will come down to whether Schumer will put the time into it or not. The report also noted that Republican senators could be looking at adding more amendments to the act to “complicate and delay” things, according to CTFN.
The debate over how to rein in Big Tech has been going on for some time, with much of the debate devoted to the American Choice and Innovation Online Act.
PYMNTS wrote that a big part of this debate is the question of how companies should or should not use their data — including things like not using the data to favor their own products or hurt competitors’. There are also questions over who will have access to the data and where it should be shared.

356,"July 8, 2022",Google Offers Concessions To Avoid US Antitrust Suit,"


Google has offered concessions to avoid a potential US antitrust lawsuit against its advertising technology business, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Google has proposed spinning off parts of its business that auctions and places ads on websites and apps into a separate company under Alphabet that could be valued at tens of billions of dollars, the report added.
Alphabet in a statement to Reuters said that it was engaging with regulators to address their concerns, adding that it has no plans to sell or exit the ad-tech business.
“We’re deeply committed to providing value to a wide array of publisher and advertiser partners in a highly competitive sector,” the Google-parent said.
The US Department for Justice sued Google in October 2020, accusing the company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals, in the biggest challenge to the power and influence of Big Tech in decades.
Britain’s competition regulator in May launched its second probe into the advertising practices of Google, saying the search giant could be distorting competition and may have illegally favored its own services.

357,"July 5, 2022",Google Opens Up Google Play Store Ahead of Potential Legislation,"


On June 30, Google announced in its blog an agreement with a group of U.S. developers to avoid costly and lengthy litigation about terms and conditions of the Google Play Store, including the fees charged. The proposed settlement, which still has to be approved by a court, will establish a $90 million fund to support U.S. developers who earned $2 million or less through Google Play during each year from 2016 to 2021.
But more important than the monetary relief, at least for the regulatory community, is the other commitments that Google is offering in the settlement that come at a crucial moment when important antitrust bills are discussed at Capitol Hill, namely, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act and the Open App Markets Act.
The former, which seeks to impose restrictions on how online platforms may display search results or how they rank their products in their online marketplaces seem to have gained momentum and different lawmakers have claimed that the bill could be sent to a Senate vote soon.
The Open App Markets Act, which will largely affect Google and Apple’s app stores, passed the Senate Judiciary Committee vote in February but the bill hasn’t enjoyed the same push in recent months and it is yet unclear when it will be sent for a full Senate vote. If approved, it would give app developers more power to reach their customers without the control of Google and Apple. The bill would allow app developers to directly reach users, to communicate with them to offer them products or sales, to offer alternative payment methods, circumventing the Big Tech’s own in-app payment systems, which in turn, it could affect the commissions paid to Apple and Google.
However, the settlement reached by Google and a group of U.S. developers included a few commitments that already go in that direction, and it could also signal how far Google is willing to go to minimize the impact of any potential legislation affecting its Google Play store in the U.S.
For instance, according to the announcement, Google will continue with a tiered pricing model, maintaining its 15% commission frate for the first $1 million in annual revenue from the app store, rather than the original 30%. It is worth noting that Google and Apple have already offered a reduced 15% commission to small developers that generate less than $1 million in revenue from Google Play.
A second commitment is that Google will change its Developer Distribution Agreement, which has been challenged in many courts around the world, “to make it clear that developers can continue to use contact information obtained in-app to communicate with users out-of-app, including about subscription offers or lower-cost offerings on a rival app store or the developer’s website. This means that, for instance, Spotify or Epic could reach its users to offer them subscriptions at a lower price in their own websites or app stores. The commitment doesn’t seem to go as far as offering developers the option to communicate with users in Google’s app. This is something that the Open App Markets Act could change.
Another important commitment offered by Google is the possibility for people to use other app stores on their android devices. This seems to open Android to other app stores. Yet, Google added that this would be possible “while being careful not to compromise the safety measures Android has in place,” which may translate into a limitation to download certain apps.
While this settlement is only binding for a group of developers, and needs to be approved by the court, it may show the way for both Google and developers moving forward if the Open Markets App Act doesn’t become law or until it is applicable.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has approved Google’s proposed acquisition of a minority stake in telecom major Bharti Airtel, as per a report by news agency PTI.
The deal has been cleared on the basis of modifications offered by the acquirer, according to an official release issued on Thursday.
Google International LLC and Airtel have entered into an investment agreement to buy a minority and non-controlling stake of 1.28 percent of equity share capital in the telecom player.
Along with the investment agreement, both companies through their affiliates have also entered into certain commercial deals. The parties also intend to enter into certain other commercial arrangements in future, as per the release.
Deals beyond a certain threshold require approval from the regulator, which keeps a tab on unfair business practices in the marketplace, PTI reported.

359,"July 1, 2022",Apple and Google’s Stranglehold Over Mobile Ecosystems: Why It’s Important And What We’re Doing About It,"
By: Will Hayter (Competition & Markets Authority Blog)
Few people would doubt just how fundamental smartphones are to our lives. They are increasingly the main way we interact with friends and family, access news, play games, buy products and services online – and now pay for them in shops. Love it or loathe it, our phones have become a key gateway for people and UK businesses alike. Moreover, for some of the poorest households in the country they are the only way to get online and a vital lifeline to essential public resources and services.  This makes the fact that the systems upon which these devices rely are almost entirely controlled by just 2 companies – Apple and Google – concerning. Apple and Google are the gatekeepers to everything coming through our phones, creating a digital stranglehold that is only getting stronger over time.
The problems uncovered in our Mobile Ecosystems Market Study
The powerful position Apple and Google have in these markets, and their impact on competition, has been the subject of our year-long study into mobile ecosystems covering operating systems, browsers and apps on our mobile devices. We concluded that it is extremely difficult for rivals such as other browsers or alternative app stores to compete. Tens of thousands of small businesses reliant on these ecosystems, such as app and web developers, are entirely at the whim of the rules and processes set by these 2 companies.

360,"March 20, 2022",DC’s AG Amazon Antitrust Suit Dismissed,"


A US court dismissed a lawsuit against Amazon.com Inc on Friday that accused the company of antitrust violations for barring third-party sellers from offering better deals for their products elsewhere, reported The Wall Street Journal. 
Judge Hiram Puig-Lugo of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia granted Amazon’s motion to dismiss the complaint filed last year by Washington D.C. attorney general Karl Racine.
“We believe that the Superior Court got this wrong, and its oral ruling did not seem to consider the detailed allegations in the complaint and a recent decision of a federal court to allow a nearly identical lawsuit to move forward,” the Office of the Attorney General spokesperson said in an emailed statement, adding that the office was considering its legal options.
Amazon argued in its motion to dismiss the D.C. lawsuit that pricing restrictions in its contracts with sellers are common in the retail industry and entirely legal.
The company also argued that the lawsuit would hurt consumers if it succeeded. Amazon has often argued on the strength of its efficiency and ability to offer customers lower prices in defence of critics of its business practices. 
“One of Amazon’s core business objectives in serving its customers is to have a reputation for low prices, and Amazon works constantly to maintain that reputation by offering competitively priced products in its store,” Amazon said in its motion to dismiss, filed in October. “The District’s case, if allowed to proceed, would undermine this pro-consumer approach.”
The D.C. attorney general’s office argued that it was Amazon that was driving up prices.
The case was brought under District of Columbia law rather than federal law, and its immediate impact would have been limited even if it had succeeded.
Amazon “has made online shopping more expensive for consumers through its anticompetitive agreements that prevent sellers from offering lower prices on and to competing online marketplaces,” the District said in its response. “These agreements curtail competition, resulting in higher prices, lower innovation and fewer choices for consumers.”

361,"March 20, 2022",DOJ Indicts 4 Companies For Price Fixing DVDs & Blu-Ray Discs On Amazon Marketplace,"


A federal grand jury in Knoxville, Tennessee, returned an indictment charging two individuals and four companies with participating in a conspiracy to fix prices of DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs sold on the Amazon Marketplace. 
According to the one-count felony indictment filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, Victor Btesh, of Brooklyn, New York, and Bruce Fish of Hayfield, Minnesota; along with BDF Enterprises Inc., a Minnesota corporation; Michelle’s DVD Funhouse Inc., a New York corporation; MJR Prime LLC, a New York corporation; and Prime Brooklyn LLC, a New York corporation, were charged with conspiring with each other and others to fix prices of DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs sold through storefronts on the Amazon Marketplace. The price-fixing conspiracy was ongoing from at least as early as October 2016 until at least Oct. 29, 2019.
“This indictment – the fifth charge to date in the ongoing investigation – demonstrates our commitment to protecting consumers and prosecuting individuals who conspire to fix prices in online marketplaces,” said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division.
“Price-fixing conspiracies in online marketplaces harm consumers and will be prosecuted,” said U.S. Attorney Francis M. Hamilton III for the Eastern District of Tennessee. 
“This indictment shows that the FBI is dedicated to protecting American consumers from unfair prices in all areas of the marketplace,” said Assistant Director Luis Quesada of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division. “The FBI and our law enforcement partners will continue to investigate conspiracies to fix prices and hinder competition for all.”  
“We are gratified to have contributed to this investigation and applaud the exceptional work by the investigative team for both protecting the individual consumer and the deterrence of activities in violation of the Sherman Act,” said Special Agent in Charge Ken Cleevely of the U.S. Postal Service, Office of Inspector General (USPS-OIG). “Along with our law enforcement partners, the USPS OIG will continue to aggressively investigate those who would engage in this type of harmful conduct.”
The Amazon Marketplace is an e-commerce platform owned and operated by Amazon.com Inc. that enables third-party vendors to sell new or used products alongside Amazon’s own offerings.
Four other individuals have been previously charged and pleaded guilty in this ongoing investigation.

362,"March 17, 2022",Amazon Closes $8.45B Deal For Movie Studio MGM,"
Amazon has closed on its $6.5 billion acquisition of movie and TV studio MGM, the company announced Thursday (March 17).
As The Wall Street Journal reports, the deal is Amazon’s second largest — following its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017. It gives the company access to a library of 4,000 movies — including the James Bond films — and 17,000 episodes of television, providing it with a better position to compete against rivals like Netflix and Disney+.
Read more: EU Approves Amazon’s $8.5B MGM Deal
Under the terms of the acquisition, MGM will become part of Amazon’s Prime Video and Studios unit, overseen by Senior Vice President Mike Hopkins. Amazon has said it doesn’t plan layoffs at the studio.
“MGM has a nearly century-long legacy of producing exceptional entertainment, and we share their commitment to delivering a broad slate of original films and television shows to a global audience,” Hopkins said in a statement.
Founded in 1920, MGM has a storied — and rocky — history in Hollywood, producing blockbusters like “The Wizard of Oz” and “Gone With The Wind.”
The deal came after Amazon demonstrated to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that it had provided all the information requested by antitrust investigators examining the acquisition, turning over more than 3 million documents for review, a source close to the matter told the Journal.
However, the FTC still has the ability to challenge the acquisition, if a majority of the commission votes to do so.
The acquisition was approved by European Union antitrust officials on Tuesday, the deadline for approval in the EU. The European Commission said the deal wouldn’t hinder competition, as the two companies don’t necessarily overlap in their production of content.
Still, Amazon remains under serious antitrust scrutiny in the U.S. Last week, a bipartisan group of U.S. representatives called on the Justice Department to investigate the company for what they say is a potential criminal obstruction of a Congressional investigation.

Amazon on Tuesday gained unconditional EU antitrust approval for its proposed $8.5 billion acquisition of US movie studio MGM to help it to compete with streaming rivals Netflix and Disney+.
The European Commission said the deal would not pose competition concerns in Europe, confirming a Reuters story on March 9.
The EU competition enforcer said it had looked into overlaps between the world’s largest online retailer and MGM in audio-visual content and found that the combined market shares are low and that they have strong rivals.
“The addition of MGM’s content into Amazon’s Prime Video offer would not have a significant impact on Amazon’s position as provider of marketplace services,” the Commission said.
Amazon said it was pleased with the EU clearance.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has a mid-March deadline to decide on the deal, a person familiar with the matter said.

Internet giant Amazon could be days away from closing its deal to buy MGM, the fabled studio behind “Rocky” and “James Bond,” as a mid-March deadline for regulators to challenge the online retailer’s merger plan approaches, reported Reuters. 
Antitrust agencies in the United States and Europe both have to decide if Amazon’s $8.5 billion deal for the nearly century-old studio breaks antitrust law. Amazon announced the transaction in May 2021, saying it offered a trove of content for the company to develop and draw consumers to its Prime fast-shipping and streaming club.
In Europe, EU antitrust regulators are set to clear the planned acquisition without conditions, according to people familiar with the matter. They have a March 15 deadline to act. 
Likewise, the US Federal Trade Commission is approaching its own deadline for making a decision on whether the deal violates antitrust law. The FTC’s deadline is in mid-March, at least a day after the European Commission’s deadline, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The online retailer substantially complied with the FTC’s requests for information about the deal, which started the clock for the FTC to make a decision, the Wall Street Journal previously reported.
Exactly when Amazon might close the deal, subject to whether or not the FTC attempts to stop the MGM merger, was unclear.
The FTC, whose Chair Lina Khan gained internet fame with a law review article entitled “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,” has a broader antitrust probe open into Amazon as part of government antitrust investigations begun under the Trump administration into the four big tech platforms, including Facebook and Google.

365,"March 14, 2022",Amazon Must Face ‘Fair Pricing’ Case Judge Rules,"
A federal Judge in Seattle ruled Amazon must face consumer antitrust litigation challenging “most favored nation”-style policies that have allegedly driven up the prices of “virtually all products offered for sale” online in the US. 
Judge Richard A. Jones let the proposed class action move forward in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington, where a group of consumers has accused Amazon of reinstituting its MFN rules—after pledging to abandon them—in the form of so-called “fair pricing” agreements, reported Bloomberg Law.
A pair of frequent Amazon shoppers, backed by major plaintiffs’ firms, filed proposed class actions in May of 2021 in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington, claiming Amazon is unlawfully enforcing “most favored nation” price policies against third-party sellers on its platform.
The provisions allegedly bar merchants who make up “the heart” of Amazon’s business from offering lower prices elsewhere. Because Amazon’s “hefty fees” make it one of the more expensive places to sell goods online, the MFN clauses drive up prices across the internet, according to the complaints.
The company’s MFN system “cements its stranglehold over sellers, because it prevents competing platforms from gaining scale by offering lower commissions to sellers and lower prices to consumers,” one of the lawsuits says.
 the new complaints accuse of Amazon of reinstituting the MFN agreements—now styled as “price parity provisions” or a “fair pricing policy”—after promising the Federal Trade Commission in 2019 that it would drop them.
Amazon “pretended to withdraw” the MFN policy, according to one of the suits. The move “was merely sleight of hand,” the other says.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has decided not to proceed against Amazon Seller Services over allegations that the e-commerce giant was using seller data to create knock-offs and boost its own listings in search results.
The CCI had asked Amazon Seller Services to file information with the Commission and decided not to proceed with the matter after reviewing submissions from Amazon. The CCI clarified, however, that the decision to not proceed with the case would not “come in the way, in any manner, in examining the conduct of ASSPL or any of its related entities either past, present or future,” if the firm’s submissions are found to be false or if the company’s conduct is found to violate competition law.
In response, CAIT called the CCI a “spineless toothless body”. The regulator had taken up the matter suo moto after a report claimed that ‘Amazon copied products and rigged search results to promote its own brands’.
E-retail giant Amazon has been in the cross-hairs of regulators worldwide over questions regarding the company’s handling of data related to sellers due to concerns the company has leveraged its considerable presence in online shopping to unfairly maintain said dominance.

In a major announcement, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has said it will accept Amazon’s proposal to fully acquire Prione Business Services.
Prione, a technology provider that offers small businesses in India’s growing digital economy a suite of services, is also the owner of Cloudtail, one of the biggest and most profitable retailers on Amazon India, reported Techcrunch. 
With the go-ahead now in place, Amazon will acquire the entire stake of Narayana Murthy-backed Catamaran Ventures in the company. The company was originally established in 2014 as a joint venture between Amazon and Catamaran.
“Commission approves acquisition of Prione Business Services Private Limited by Amazon Asia-Pacific Resources Private Limited,” said CCI in a tweet on Wednesday.
Senior Amazon India executives are expected to hold a meeting on the matter this week, according to the sources.
Amazon announced its plans to take full control of Prione Business Services in December of 2021, subject to the requisite regulatory approvals. On August 09, 2021, the partners had announced their decision to not continue the JV beyond the end of its current term in May 2022.
Under India’s current regulations it remains unclear whether Cloudtail will be able to continue its operations as a seller on Amazon’s marketplace, as India prohibits foreign direct investment (FDI) in inventory-based models for e-commerce and permits firms such as Amazon India and Flipkart to work only as marketplaces for other businesses.

In a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, members of the House Judiciary committee accused the company of obstructing its 16-month antitrust investigation by refusing to turn over information and lying about how it treated third-party sellers on its platform.

“Throughout the investigation and in follow-up inquiries, senior executives at Amazon engaged in a pattern and practice of misleading behavior before the committee,” a bipartisan group of lawmakers including the House Judiciary committee chairman, Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, said in the letter to the Justice Department (DOJ). “Amazon and its executives must be held accountable for this behavior.”
In 2019 the House panel’s antitrust subcommittee focused its investigation on whether the company used data about its customers to advance the sale of its own private-label products over those of third-party vendors. 
In their letter members of the committee said Amazon executives, including a lawyer who testified before the committee, repeatedly denied that the company used customer data to harm competition. However, the company has previously admitted that employees may access ‘aggregate data’ on third-party sellers that might not be as secure or anonymous as previously claimed. 
Amazon, as part of the so-called Big Tech giants that dominate the modern digital economy, has been involved in several simultaneous legal challenges over its practices in recent years, as a more robust data regulation regime is being worked out by major jurisdictions.

The MGM acquisition would give the world’s largest online retailer rights to James Bond, one of the most lucrative franchises in film history that’s earned nearly $7 billion at the box office globally, according to MGM.
MGM also licences content for video games, which could benefit Amazon’s development efforts in that area.
Amazon, which has been the focus of a long-running investigation into the company’s business practices, as well as a probe into the MGM deal, could fall into that category. The FTC could also file suit, at which point the merger outcome would be determined by antitrust litigation that could go on for months or years.
Amazon’s purchase of MGM has drawn opposition from both politicians and labor organizations, concerned that the acquisition of a major film studio will increase Amazon’s ability to leverage its power in the Streaming Video-On-Demand market, possibly harming consumers, rival competitors, and film industry workers.

Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen told EU lawmakers that draft rules requiring tech firms to do more to tackle illegal online content could become a global gold standard for a safer online world if they are beefed up.
Haugen, a former Facebook employee who worked as a product manager on the company’s civic misinformation team, has accused the social media giant of repeatedly prioritising profit over clamping down on hate speech and misinformation, reported Reuters. 
Her testimony to a European Parliament committee comes after stops in London, Lisbon and Berlin, and at a time when EU lawmakers are debating whether to firm up the Digital Services Act (DSA) proposed by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager.

Defunct photo app startup Phhhoto filed an antitrust lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York against Facebook alleging the social media giant used anti-competitive tactics intended to pick off rivals, according to The New York Times on Friday (Nov. 5). Phhhoto is seeking unspecified monetary damages.
According to the lawsuit, Phhhoto’s founders allege that Facebook feigned interest in the app but instead launched their own product with similar features — Instagram. Phhhoto founders Champ Bennett, Omar Elsayed, and Russell Armand also claim that Facebook buried its content on Instagram.
Attorney Gary L. Reback is representing Phhhoto and told the Times that he hasn’t seen anti-competitive behavior like Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg have exhibited since he convinced the Department of Justice to go after Microsoft in the 1990s.
Joe Osborne, a spokesperson for Facebook’s parent company Meta, told the Times that the lawsuit has no merit and “we will defend ourselves vigorously.”
Founded in 2012 and rolling out its app in 2014, Phhhoto found early popularity from celebrities and was also favored by people using the app to edit photos and string them together in looping videos.
The suit alleges that Facebook strung the company along, dangling a deal that never surfaced. Instead, Phhhoto claims that Facebook ensured its content couldn’t be found and that Phhhoto users couldn’t connect with their friends on Instagram.

374,"October 29, 2021",Frances Haugen Wants A Digital Regulator — And So Does Facebook,"
By: Harold Feld (Public Knowledge)
Frances Haugen, the (hopefully first of many) Facebook whistleblower, made one thing abundantly clear this week in both her 60 Minutes interview and her Senate Hearing: The United States needs a specialized agency to oversee digital platforms. Antitrust enforcement alone is not enough. Breaking up Facebook would solve some problems, but without additional oversight it will also produce a bunch of smaller companies all running algorithms that maximize engagement regardless of the harm to society (something I have called the “Starfish Problem” — tear up a starfish and the pieces regenerate into lots of smaller starfish). Companies, Haugen warned, “will always put profits over people.” Haugen further emphasized that effectively regulating Facebook (and other digital platforms) requires specialized expertise about the sector. “Right now, the only people in the world trained to analyze these experiences are people who grew up inside of Facebook,” Haugen said. We don’t just need new laws, or to expand the Federal Trade Commission. As Haugen stressed multiple times, we need a specialized, sector-specific regulator to do the job right.
Back in May, Facebook V.P. of Global Public Affairs Nick Clegg wrote an op-ed also calling for the creation of a digital regulator. “Finally,” writes Clegg, “the U.S. could create a new digital regulator. Not only would a new regulator be able to navigate the competing trade-offs in the digital space, it would be able to join the dots between issues like content, data, and economic impact — much like the Federal Communications Commission has successfully exercised regulatory oversight over telecoms and media.”
How do these two diametrically opposed people arrive at the same recommendation? Does the fact that Facebook also says it wants a regulator automatically make it a bad idea? Given that Public Knowledge has repeatedly pushed for a sector-specific regulator since 2018, we obviously don’t think so. But if a sector-specific regulator is the right answer, why is Facebook also pushing for a digital regulator?…

“If we stand together, then we can make real changes,” Vestager said. “And just to make Facebook assess the risk that they could pose to young people’s mental health and to have, you know, external people looking into that assessment to see if things have been corrected, that would be an important step forward.”
“We also need to regulate much tighter if we are dealing with someone who can have an immense influence both on mental health, but also how our democracy develops,” she added, explaining that the EU Commission had prepared legislation that balances the need to preserve freedom of speech but to get rid of things that “are illegal offline” such as incitement to violence.

376,"October 28, 2021",Facebook’s New Name Is Meta & They Will Refocus On VR,"


Facebook  is now called Meta, the company announced on Thursday, October 28, in a rebrand that focuses on investing in the “metaverse,” a shared virtual environment that it bets will be the successor to the mobile internet.
The name change comes as the world’s largest social media company battles criticisms from lawmakers and regulators over its market power, algorithmic decisions, and the policing of abuses on its services.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg, speaking at the company’s live-streamed virtual and augmented reality conference, said the new name reflected its ambitions to build the metaverse, rather than its namesake social media service, which will continue to be called Facebook.
The metaverse is a term coined in the dystopian novel “Snow Crash” three decades ago and now attracting buzz in Silicon Valley. It refers broadly to the idea of a shared virtual realm which can be accessed by people using different devices.
“Right now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can’t possibly represent everything that we’re doing today, let alone in the future,” said Zuckerberg.

Federal Trade Commission staffers have begun looking into disclosures that Facebook’s internal company research had identified ill effects from its products, according to The Wall Street Journal.Officials are looking into whether Facebook research documents indicate that it might have violated a 2019 settlement with the agency over privacy concerns, for which the company paid a record $5 billion penalty, one of the people said.
The internal research found evidence that the company’s algorithms foster discord and that its Instagram app is harmful for a sizable percentage of its users, notably teenage girls, among other findings. The documents provided the foundation for The Wall Street Journal’s Facebook Files series.
In a statement, Facebook said that it is “always ready to answer regulators’ questions and will continue to cooperate with government inquiries.”
“Beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to a former employee’s allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being,” the company said in its quarterly earnings filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Juliana Gruenwald of the FTC’s Office of Public Affairs declined to comment, adding, “FTC investigations are nonpublic so we generally do not comment on whether we are investigating a particular matter.”

378,"October 25, 2021",Australian Publisher Asks Regulator To Enforce New Facebook Law,"


On Monday an Australian publisher is calling for the government to enforce a new law to compel Facebook to negotiate a content deal, prompting the architect of the rule to say he was “concerned” about the social media giant’s behavior.
The petition by academic publisher The Conversation was emailed to its readers at the weekend. According to Reuters it reflects a groundswell of disquiet among smaller Australian outlets who have not reached deals with Facebook, as mandated by the new law.
Facebook and Google have been required since March to negotiate with Australian outlets for content that drives traffic, and advertising, to their websites. If they don’t, the government may take over the negotiation.

379,"October 22, 2021",Facebook Agrees To Pay French Publishers For News,"


Facebook has reached a multiyear agreement to pay French publishers for re-sharing their content on its platforms, it announced today.
The social media giant said the licensing agreement with the Alliance of national and regional newspapers “means that people on Facebook will be able to continue uploading and sharing news stories freely amongst their communities, whilst also ensuring that the copyright of our publishing partners is protected.”
Facebook declined to specify how much it’s paying for the arrangement with l’Alliance de la presse d’information générale (APIG) in France when we asked. But in a blog post trumpeting the deal it wrote: “After constructive negotiations, this solution will further our investment in the news industry, and strengthen the news experience for both people and publishers on Facebook.”
The blog post also specifies that it will be investing “at least” a billion dollars to support media companies over the next three years — however that’s a collective pot not a France-only pot. So who is getting what exactly — and where — remains unclear.
Facebook’s largesse in France is not voluntary: The development relates to EU law that was updated to reform digital copyright rules back in 2019 to, among other tweaks, extend neighboring rights to snippets of publishers’ content in response to criticism from the newspaper industry that adtech giants were freeloading off quality journalism that users of their platforms share.

Apple has won the support of the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers’ advocacy group in a court fight over claims the iPhone maker’s App Store is anti-competitive.
The Americans for Prosperity Foundation, founded by David and Charles Koch and known for supporting libertarian conservative causes, was the first to submit a filing on Thursday’s deadline for groups to weigh in on Apple’s side in its battle with Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite.
Apple mostly won its 2021 trial with Epic, but the iPhone maker is asking the San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn a portion of a judge’s September ruling finding that the App Store’s business model violates California’s unfair competition law.
The non-profit foundation argues the judge’s legal analysis was faulty, emphasizing that antitrust laws are meant to protect competition, “not competitors.”

The Dutch consumer watchdog on Monday levied a 10th weekly fine against Apple for failure to comply with an order to make it possible for dating app providers in the Netherlands to use non-Apple payment methods.
The Authority for Consumers and Markets said its fines against the company in the long-running dispute now total 50 million euros ($55 million), the maximum possible under its current order.

It said Apple had submitted a new proposal for complying with the order on Sunday – a move the watchdog said it welcomed but that came too late to avoid the fine.
Apple’s practice of requiring developers to use its system and pay commissions of 15-30% on digital goods purchases has come under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world.
Although the Dutch case is limited to dating apps in the Netherlands, it could set a precedent for the US company, which has denied wrongdoing. The ACM has been levying weekly fines against the company in the dispute since January.

382,"March 27, 2022",Apple Asks Court To Reject Epic’s Appeal In App Store Case,"


Apple told appellate judges on Thursday that video game maker Epic Games had failed to show any legal error that would justify them overturning a lower-court ruling that found key App Store policies do not break US antitrust law.
Epic, known for its Fortnite game, largely lost a trial last year over whether Apple’s payment rules for apps were anticompetitive. That decision found Apple had suitable reasons to force some app makers such as Epic to use its payment system and take commissions of 15 percent to 30 percent on their sales.
Following the ruling, Epic appealed in the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals. Apple in its reply on Thursday said Epic had failed to propose a reasonable alternative to the App Store policies.
“Epic asks the Judiciary to fundamentally change the App Store by forcing Apple to abandon the integrated distribution and digital-content delivery model that, among many other procompetitive benefits, helps safeguard user security and privacy,” the court filing said.
In the appeal, ‌Epic Games‌ asked whether Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers had made mistakes with some of her findings, including that Apple is not a monopolist.
Both Apple and Epic are scheduled to file a second round of arguments before the appeals panel calls a hearing, for possibly next year. In support of Epic’s appeal, attorneys general for 34 US states and the District of Columbia said in January that Apple is stifling competition through its mobile app store.
Both Epic and Apple filed appeals following the initial ruling, asking for a stay on the injunction that lets developers add in-app links to payment websites, according to company representatives and documents filed on October 8.

Apple is facing yet another €5 million ($5.5 million) fine in the Netherlands for failing to sufficiently meet recently mandated alternative payment system requirements for dating apps, reports Reuters.
The iPhone maker has already racked up 45 million euros ($49 million) in penalties to date as ACM (Authority for Consumers and Markets) has slapped weekly 5 million euro fines on the company since January, with the ninth penalty handed out this week.
Apple submitted a fresh proposal to the ACM this week in a bid to halt the sanction. The offer does not fully comply with its order, an official at the Dutch watchdog, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters on Friday.
Subsequent fines once the total penalty hits 50 million euros could be higher according to ACM rules.
Apple, which requires developers to use its system and pay commissions of 15-30% on digital goods purchases and is feeling regulatory scrutiny worldwide over this, was not immediately available for comment.
An investigation by ACM on whether Apple’s practices amounted to an abuse of a dominant market position was launched in 2019. It was later reduced in scope to focus primarily on dating market apps, including Tinder owner Match Group.
“We disagree with the order issued by the ACM and have filed an appeal,” Apple said in a statement. It added that “Apple does not have a dominant position in the market for software distribution in the Netherlands, has invested tremendous resources helping developers of dating apps reach customers and thrive on the App Store.”

Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai will meet Europe’s antitrust chief on March 30 to discuss competition and digital issues, a European Commission official said on Thursday.
Alphabet confirmed the meeting with the EU’s top competition official.
Margrethe Vestager has handed out more than 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) in fines to the world’s most popular internet search engine in the last decade for hindering rivals in shopping comparison websites and online search advertising, and over its Android mobile operating system.
She is also investigating Alphabet unit Google’s digital advertising business and its online display advertising deal with Meta Platforms Inc. As part of its investigation, the CMA will consider whether an agreement between Google and Meta (previously Facebook) – which Google internally codenamed “Jedi Blue” – broke the law. This secret pact was the focus of an investigation in the United States looking into the claim that Google executives “induced” senior Facebook staff to agree to a plan to undermine competition in digital advertising.
Vestager has also proposed rules that could force Google and other US tech giants to change their core business models. The new European Digital Markets Act which aims to rein in Big Tech may enter into force by the end of the year after the EU institutions reached an agreement on Thursday on the final text of the bill.

385,"March 23, 2022",Apple Acquires UK’s Credit Kudos,"


Apple has bought the U.K. open banking startup Credit Kudos in a transaction estimated at $150 million a report said Wednesday March 23.
Credit Kudos’ services offer insights and scores on loan applicants drawn from bank data, particularly transaction and loan outcome data. It’s sourced from the U.K.’s open banking framework. The application programming interface (API) offers lenders better decision making, less risk and more acceptance rates.
The report from The Block news site noted that Credit Kudos last raised money at the height of the pandemic, in April 2020. Then it was able to nail down £5 million, or $6.5 million. 
The COVID-19 pandemic spurred the development of various online industries as consumers across the world faced varying levels of restrictions on movement and public venues, including shopping centers and banks, were closed down or made harder to access.
That round was led by AlbionVC, with TriplePoint Capital, Plug and Play Ventures, Ascension Ventures’ Fair by Design fund, Entrepreneur First and several angel backers.
Credit Kudos was founded in 2015 by Freddy Kelly and Matt Schofield. It’s one of many big European open banking acquisitions in the last year. However this is the first one to be subsumed by a tech giant of Apple’s size.

The report notes that there’s no indication what Apple has planned for Credit Kudos. Apple has branched out over the years, extending far beyond its initial stronghold of home computers and high-end smartphones into various areas of the digital economy including video streaming, cloud storage, and payment systems.
Credit Kudos teamed with Atom Bank last year to add open data capabilities for business loan affordability assessments, PYMNTS wrote.
The goal is to deliver over £1 billion in lending in the next two years. Atom Bank plans to use Credit Kudos’ categorization and risk insights to automate underwriting, which will allow faster decision making.

Ius Omnibus, an association that handles lawsuits against consumer protection companies, launched a series of more popular lawsuits this week, this time against tech giants Google and Apple. The class action was filed with the Competition and Anti-Competitive Practices Tribunal of the two companies, as announced in the filing.
In both lawsuits, Jus Omnibus asks the Santarém court to recognize a one-time and persistent violation of the rights of the two companies, which caused “damage to the scattered and / or collective interests of protecting the consumption of goods and services and competition”, condemning the two companies for anti-competitive practices and ordering compensation “to all those affected Portuguese consumers.

The problem is that Google enters into “anti-competitive contracts with Android hardware manufacturers and app developers culminating in a 30% commission on each sale,” the value of which “passed on to consumers.”

Reported by Reuters, Apple is facing an antitrust lawsuit from AliveCor yet again. The Silicon Valley company claims it is monopolizing the market in the US for heart rate monitoring apps. The company says Apple has “complete control” over the market for these health apps.
In an earlier suit, the privately held company accused Apple, whose market value exceeds US$2 trillion, of quietly “working in the background” to copy its ability to record an ECG on the Apple Watch, and to provide a separate app for heart-rate analysis.
According to US District Judge Jeffrey White, AliveCor could prove that Apple violated federal antitrust law. AliveCor Inc. runs the SmartRhythm app that alerts users to irregular heartbeats. It also sells the KardiaBand wristband that records ECGs, and has worked with various partners in developing technologies to detect a variety of conditions. 
“AliveCor alleges that Apple made changes to the heart rate algorithm that made it effectively impossible for third parties to inform a user when to take an ECG,” claims White. “Plaintiff’s allegations plausibly establish that Apple’s conduct was anticompetitive.”
However, AliveCor’s separate claim that Apple has an illegal monopoly over ECG-capable wearable technology was dismissed.

388,"March 22, 2022",Apple Facing 9th Weekly Fine From Dutch Watchdog,"


For the ninth time, Apple is facing a 5 million euro ($5.51 million) fine in the Netherlands over an antitrust order. The Dutch consumer watchdog, Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM), has levied the fines against the Cupertino-based company each week for not complying with an antitrust-related order.
In December 2021, ACM ordered Apple to change its App Store payment policies for dating software. The regulator insisted Apple must offer alternative payment options for such software on its App Store. These options needed to be available to users both within and outside the app, ACM stipulated.
Apple claimed it had met the requirements of the order, and has been in compliance since January 15. However, ACM pointed out that Cupertino had only allowed dating-app providers to express their interest in alternative payment methods. The developers remained unable to actually offer the additional choices, so the Dutch regulator began imposing weekly fines on Apple.
The challenge dating-app providers faced, and one ACM called unreasonable, is they had to submit brand new apps to take advantage of the new payment methods. This meant starting the development and review process from scratch, rather than just updating their existing apps.
Within a few weeks, additional payment options began to appear for dating-app developers. The apps could allow payments through Apple’s in-app payments system, a third-party service, or an in-app link to the developer’s website. Still, Cupertino said it would continue to charge a 27% commission on such transactions. This was only 3 percentage points lower than the standard 30% commission typically charged.

389,"March 21, 2022",Apple Offers New Concessions To Dutch Regulators,"


Apple has been fined again in the Netherlands over an antitrust order related to dating apps. The order requires the US- based company to allow local dating apps to be able to use third-party payment technologies if their developers wish, rather than being locked to only being able to use Apple’s in-app payment API for iOS.
Since January, the Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) has levied a series of (weekly) penalties against Apple for what it asserts is continued non-compliance with the order.
The Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) said Apple abused its dominant market position by not allowing software applications in the Netherlands to use any other payment modes. The company had a Jan. 15 deadline to comply with the ACM, but didn’t do so.
The latest €5 million fine (the ninth) brings the total penalties against Apple on this issue up to €45 million (out of a maximum possible of €50 million if it again fails to satisfy the regulator by next week).
Apple has responded to the string of fines over this period by claiming it is complying with the order — despite the regulator clearly taking a different view.
Apple has fought any attempt so far to open up its App Store to third parties. For instance, in South-Korea, Apple challenged a new regulation that ordered the tech giant to loosen its grip over the app economy. In Europe, the company is also fighting a similar Continent-wide order that would force the tech Giant’s payment systems open.

391,"October 10, 2021",EU Probes Microsoft Rivals Over Teams Integration In Office,"


EU antitrust regulators are following up on a complaint by Slack Technologies by asking Microsoft’s rivals if its Teams app integrated with its Office product gives it greater clout, reported Reuters.
In a questionnaire sent to rivals and seen by Reuters, the European Commission is focusing on the period 2016 to 2021. Microsoft introduced Teams in early 2017 to compete with Slack and others in the fast-growing workplace collaboration market.
Slack, bought by business software maker Salesforce in July, took its grievance over Microsoft’s Teams software to the Commission last year.
Microsoft, which has been handed €2.2 billion (US$2.6 billion) in EU fines for cases involving so-called tying and other practices in the previous decade, declined to comment.
Slack alleged that tying or bundling Teams with Office was illegal and urged the EU competition agency to separate the two.
It claimed that Microsoft pre-installs the workplace chat, it was difficult to uninstall and that the US company refused to provide information which would allow rival products to work with Teams and Office.
This has prompted the Commission to ask if bundled products give companies access to data that may increase their market power in both markets and at the same time make it harder for rivals, in particular those with only product, to compete.

Developers have long criticized Apple’s commissions of between 15% and 30% on many App Store purchases, what some developers see as an opaque and unpredictable app-vetting process.

A federal judge asked Microsoft on Friday to let him know how big of a burden it would be for the company to provide documents requested by long-time rival Alphabet’s Google, in a US antitrust lawsuit against Google.

Google served a subpoena to Microsoft more than three months ago, seeking documents regarding Microsoft’s Bing search engine as well as its Internet Explorer and Edge but has not received them, the filing said.
Google says some of the documents might shed light on whether Microsoft was actually restrained from competing with Google, or whether it simply failed to compete successfully.
“In particular, there are nineteen Microsoft employees who held important positions relating to activities at the core of this case but whose files Microsoft refuses to commit to search at this time,” Google said in the filing.

Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said the company “is on the right side of history” in the antitrust debates about whether big technology companies abuse user privacy and squash competition, reported Bloomberg. 
While Congress and U.S. regulators have clashed with Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. over the companies’ business practices, Microsoft hasn’t received the same kind of scrutiny more than 20 years after it was sued by the U.S. Justice Department on antitrust issues.
The software company “makes sure” user privacy and internet safety are among its highest priorities for products “and then when it comes to competition, I mean you should go talk to the people who are investing a lot of capital and a lot of M&A competing with Microsoft and we welcome that,” Nadella said Wednesday in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
During the interview, the Microsoft CEO also spoke about cybersecurity threats, the future of remote work and the company’s rivalry with Alphabet’s Google.
Nadella said he is concerned about the wave of hacks in the past few months, which have included ransomware attacks that stopped business at a major pipeline company and food producer in the US.
“We have another real pandemic, which is a cyber” pandemic, he said. “The level of attacks for sure have increased, but the need for our response to be top notch has also increased. We just have to get better as an industry.”
Nadella also discussed tensions with Google, following the end of a five-year cease-fire between the two companies, which mutually agreed not to fuel legal lobbying efforts against one another. He said he “has a lot of respect” for Google and its leadership.
“We’re fighting the good fight to sort of compete against colossal lead in that space,” he said of digital advertising sales, which is led by Google and Facebook.
Nadella weighed in on Microsoft’s work-from-home policy, emphasizing the importance of flexibility and accommodating “changed expectations” in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. He spoke with Bloomberg Television after appearing at Microsoft’s Inspire conference for partners, where the company among its announcements unveiled a cloud-based version of Windows aimed at remote workers.

The US Department of Defense announced it’s calling off the US$10 billion cloud contract that was the subject of a legal battle involving Amazon and Microsoft. But it’s also announcing a new contract and soliciting proposals from both cloud service providers where both will likely clinch a reward.
The JEDI, or Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, deal has become one of the most tangled contracts for the Department of Defense. In a press release Tuesday, the Pentagon said that “due to evolving requirements, increased cloud conversancy, and industry advances, the JEDI Cloud contract no longer meets its needs.”
Shares of Microsoft were down about 0.4% following the news and Amazon shares were up 3.5% after already reaching a 52-week high.
The fight over a cloud computing project does not appear to be completely over yet. The Pentagon stated in the press release that it still needs enterprise-scale cloud capability and announced a new multi-vendor contract known as the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability.
The agency stated it plans to solicit proposals from both Amazon and Microsoft for the contract, adding that they are the only cloud service providers that can meet its needs. But, it added, it will continue to do market research to see if others could also meet its specifications.
The lucrative JEDI contract was intended to modernize the Pentagon’s IT operations for services rendered over as many as 10 years. Microsoft was awarded the cloud computing contract in 2019, beating out market leader Amazon Web Services.
A month later, Amazon’s cloud computing unit, AWS, filed a lawsuit in the US Court of Federal Claims protesting the JEDI decision.

US antitrust regulators have approved Microsoft’s  deal to buy artificial intelligence and speech technology company Nuance Communications, according to a filing made by Nuance to the government.

That expiration “satisfies one of the conditions to the closing of the merger,” the company said in the filing.
The Nuance deal is expected to bolster Microsoft’s presence in healthcare, with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella saying, “Nuance provides the AI layer at the healthcare point of delivery and is a pioneer in the real-world application of enterprise AI. AI is technology’s most important priority, and healthcare is its most urgent application. Together, with our partner ecosystem, we will put advanced AI solutions into the hands of professionals everywhere to drive better decision-making and create more meaningful connections, as we accelerate growth of Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare and Nuance.”

Microsoft will decrease the share of money it charges independent developers that publish PC games on its online store, starting in August, reported The New York Times.
Developers will keep 88% of the revenue from their games, up from 70%. That could make Microsoft’s store more attractive to independent studios than competitors like Valve’s gaming store, called Steam, which typically starts by taking a 30% cut. Epic Games’ store takes 12%.
“We want to make sure that we’re competitive in the market,” said Sarah Bond, a Microsoft vice president who leads the gaming ecosystem organization. “Our objective is to have a leading revenue share and really a leading platform.”
The share of revenue that developers get to keep has come under greater scrutiny across the tech industry. Google and Apple have faced antitrust questions for the 30% fees they charge developers whose programs appear in their app stores.

Microsoft has agreed to acquire speech-recognition firm Nuance Communications for US$19.7 billion, adding to a series of big deals the company has struck to offer an expanded range of software tools to its customers.
The two companies on Monday, April 12, announced that Microsoft agreed to pay US$56 per Nuance share in the all-cash deal, a 23% premium over Friday’s closing price. The deal value includes Nuance debt, the companies said.
The acquisition is Microsoft’s second largest under CEO Satya Nadella after the company spent about US$26 billion for professional network LinkedIn in 2016.
Nuance, based in Burlington, Massachusetts, was a pioneer in speech recognition and artificial intelligence technology. Its software formed the basis of Apple’s Siri voice assistant before the Cupertino, California-based company switched to an in-house version. Nuance has explored a possible sale as far back as 2014, when Samsung Electronics and private-equity firms were seen as the most likely buyers.

400,"June 30, 2022",Google Faces New EU Complaints Over Privacy,"


Consumer groups in Europe have filed complaints against Google for using “deceptive design, unclear language and misleading choices” in its sign-up process, the European Consumer Organization (BEUC) said in a press release. 
“Contrary to what Google claims about protecting consumers’ privacy, tens of millions of Europeans have been placed on a fast track to surveillance when they signed up to a Google account,” said BEUC deputy director Ursula Pachl.
Europe’s GDPR rules are supposed to make it easy to choose settings that protect your privacy, but Google violates that principal when you create an account, it claims. It also emphasizes that having a Google account is a must for the Android users if they want to get apps from Google Play.
Signup is the critical point at which Google makes users indicate their ‘choices’ about how their Google account will operate. With only one step, the consumer activates all the account settings that feed Google’s surveillance activities. Google does not provide consumers with the option to turn all settings ‘off’ in one click,” the BEUC wrote.
If you do want more privacy-friendly options, you have to use manual personalization involving “five steps with nine clicks and grappling with information that is unclear, complete and misleading,” it added.

401,"June 29, 2022",Apple & Google Hit With Class Actions By Australian Apps,"


Apple and Google Android users in Australia are suing the California-based technology giants, alleging they used their market power to force app developers to use their payment systems, resulting in higher prices for consumers.
Twin legal actions allege Apple and Google have “a substantial degree of power in the markets for the purchase” of apps via the App Store and Google Play Store respectively, and the in-app purchase of content.
The two tech giants allegedly used their market power in the distribution of apps in Australia to force developers to use Apple and Google payment systems for apps and in-app purchases, then charged commissions of 30 per cent, or in some limited cases 15 per cent.
The class actions on behalf of consumers alleged this conduct breached Australian Consumer Law and resulted in higher prices than if competition was allowed in payment methods for apps and in-app purchases.
It is alleged Apple and Google had superior bargaining positions to app developers; took advantage of that position to breach consumer law; required developers to enter into non-negotiable, standard contracts that the tech giants would unilaterally amend; and the conduct was not necessary to protect their business interests.
The lawsuits include estimates that 55 per cent of the 20.6 million smartphones in Australia are iPhones and 45 percent of people use phones with the Android operating system.

402,"June 27, 2022",Google Endorses Bill To Limit White House Data Demands,"
Big Tech companies have been embroiled in legislative discussions in Washington D.C. for more than a year. Most of their attention has been devoted to discussing the pros and cons of a particular piece of proposed antitrust legislation: the American Choice and Innovation Online Act. 
At the center of the debate surrounding this bill, and around similar bills that seek to regulate how Big Tech firms operate their platforms, is how companies should use their data — or rather, how not to use it (for instance, not using the data to favor its own products in detriment of its competitors) — and who has access to it, like how much data from online advertising or data from the app stores should be shared with third parties.  
But on Thursday, June 23, Ken Walker, Google’s president of Global Affairs, wrote an opinion on the company’s blog sending a message to the government that citizens should know who has access to their data, even if it is the government who demands access to it. 
In the post, Walker commended the bipartisan House passage of the NDO (non-disclosure orders) Fairness Act, a bill sponsored by Chairman Nadler and Representative Fitzgerald that would make improvements to the Stored Communications Act. 
The Stored Communications Act sets the rules that control government demands to providers to disclose information about their users. One of those rules lets the government seek orders to prevent providers like Google from telling users about the demands for data. These so-called NDO or “gag orders” have become commonplace, Walker said. 
According to Walker, the company has seen an increased use of NDOs, what means that providers can’t notify users their data has been shared until long after compliance, if ever, and people don’t have the opportunity to go to court to contest disclose orders. NDOs can cover requests for data of well-established reputable organizations, even though notifying the company is highly unlikely to do harm, Walker argued: “It is time to reform this practice, requiring more robust review before gag orders are issued.”
By endorsing the NDO Fairness Act, Google is seeking more transparency for users and the public, the company said. The proposed bill would provide for strict scrutiny analysis to grant a gag order request, it would establish time limits to the order (30-day limit) and it would require firms to notify the customer within 72 hours of the expiration of the delay, including what information was disclosed. Additionally, providers like Google could contest gag orders in court. 
Public demands for data and adequate protection of citizens’ data against abuses may acquire a new dimension in the aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling on Roe v Wade. As many as thirteen states have trigger bans in place that will outlaw abortion. Big Tech firms may find themselves in the middle of legal battles about how their data may be used to track and locate abortion clinics, individuals or other providers that could facilitate an activity that will now be illicit. The Supreme Court ruling didn’t change the rules for data collection, but it surely added more food for thought about how to assess government and public prosecutors demands for citizens’ data.

403,"June 27, 2022",Google Faces EU Complaint By Danish Job-Search Rival,"


Google faces an antitrust complaint on Monday by Danish online job-search rival Jobindex, which told European Union regulators the Alphabet-owned business had allegedly unfairly favoured its own job-search service.
The complaint could reinvigorate EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager’s scrutiny of the service, Google for Jobs. Three years ago, Vestager said she was looking into the issue but she has yet to take any action.
The European Commission said it would assess the complaint according to the standard procedures. Jobindex’s action comes four years after German media group Axel Springer’s jobs portal Stepstone filed a similar complaint against Google.
Google, which has been fined more than 8 billion euros ($8.4 billion) by Vestager in recent years for various anti-competitive practices, says it partners with job providers to direct people to websites with job listings relevant to them.
“Any jobs provider, big or small, is able to take part and companies are seeing increased traffic and job matches as a result of this feature,” a Google spokesperson said.
Launched in Europe in 2018, Google for Jobs triggered criticism from 23 online job-search websites in 2019. They said they had lost market share after the online search giant had allegedly used its market power to push its new service.

404,"June 26, 2022",Italian Data Protection Authority Latest to Rule Against Google Analytics,"


To add to its antitrust headaches, EU-wide pressure on website operators to restrain their usage of Google continues to put pressure on the company.
The Italian data protection authority, the GDPD, has ruled that the use of Google Analytics by Caffeina Media Srl is in breach of the EU’s GDPR legislation.
The issue relates to the way Google Analytics transfers browser data to the U.S. for processing. The authority makes the case that the wholesale export of data including IP address, browser information, OS, screen resolution, language selection, plus the date and time of the site visit, does not offer the necessary level GDPR mandated protection against surveillance by U.S. intelligence agencies.
In a statement, the GDPD said it “draws the attention of all Italian managers of websites, public and private, to the illegality of transfers made to the United States through GA.”
The decision follows a similar ruling by the French data protection watchdog, the CNIL, on June 8. The CNIL has issued its own updated guidance cautioning against uses of Google Analytics that would send personal data to the U.S.
Legal issues centered on Google Analytics have been brewing since a 2020 ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) that invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield. Intended as a legal framework for data-sharing between the European Union and the United States, the ECJ struck the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield down over the risk of unlawful access to Europeans’ data by U.S. intelligence agencies.

Comcast’s video advertisement division, Freewheel, can help Netflix with technology to deliver ads, while NBCUniversal’s sales team can assist the streaming service provider with selling advertisements in the United States and Europe, the report added.
Google, which already has a relationship with Netflix as a provider of ad-buying tools, could pursue an exclusive deal with the company, the report said.

406,"June 22, 2022",Google Faces New Russian Fines,"


The ongoing battle between Google and Russian regulators continued on Wednesday, as the country’s communications agency said the tech giant could be fined again for not deleting banned content, according to Reuters.
Regulator Roskomnadzor said that Google’s YouTube video-sharing site has “deliberately” promoted content it says is “misleading information about the progress of the special military operation in Ukraine,” while adding that it is “discrediting the armed forces of the Russian Federation.”
In late February, Russia invaded Ukraine, an action it calls a “special military operation.” Roskomnadzor added that a second fine could result in a levy of between 5% and 10% of annual turnover in Russia, with the exact amount determined by a court.
Google has already been fined once in Russia, receiving a levy of more than 7B roubles ($143M) for failing to delete illegal content late last year.
Last week, it was reported that Google’s Russian subsidiary had filed for bankruptcy. Despite the bankruptcy filing, free Google services, such as Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, and Google Play will remain accessible in Russia,.
Separately last week, a Russian government official said that he expected Google to remain in the country.
The official who made the comments, Anton Gorelkin, the deputy head of the State Duma committee on information policy, added that Moscow did not intend to block its video-sharing site, YouTube.
Google parent Alphabet recently allowed advertising rivals to place ads on YouTube – a concession that offered a path to settle an EU antitrust investigation without a fine.

Google has committed to resolving a copyright dispute in France over online content, the country’s antitrust authority said on Tuesday.
Google, owned by Alphabet, also dropped its appeal against a 500 million euro ($528 million) fine, the authority said. The fine was paid last year.
The decision ends the authority’s investigation into Google, which has agreed to talk with news agencies and other publishers about paying them for using their news on its platform.
Google will commit to a remuneration proposal within three months of the start of negotiations, and if no agreement can be found, the matter will be settled by a court.
The US company will also ensure the negotiations will have no impact on the way the news is presented on its search pages.
The ruling comes as international pressure mounts on online platforms such as Google and Facebook to share more revenue with news outlets.
“The authority believes that the commitments made by Google have the characteristics to address the competition concerns,” France’s Autorite de la Concurrence said in its ruling.
The head of the antitrust authority, Benoit Coeure, said the ruling would be closely examined by other European countries.

408,"June 21, 2022",Google Maps Faces German Antitrust Watchdog Probe,"


Google is under investigation by Germany’s antitrust watchdog amid concerns over potentially illegal terms for the use of its maps platform.
The Federal Cartel Office said Tuesday it opened a formal probe after initial findings suggest that the US giant is limiting options to use alternative map providers when app developers and other businesses seek to combine their offerings with maps. The regulator is also looking at the terms for Google’s Automotive Services, according to the statement.
Andreas Mundt, president of the watchdog, said it had reason to believe that Google “may be restricting the combination of its own map services with third-party map services, for example when it comes to embedding Google Maps location data, the search function or Google Street View into maps not provided by Google”.
The move comes after the Federal Cartel Office in January classified Google´as a company of “paramount significance across markets”, paving the way for the authorities to clamp down on any potentially anti-competitive activities.
Parallel proceedings are already ongoing to examine Google’s terms and conditions for data processing and its news offer Google News Showcase.
An amendment of the German Competition Act came into force last year, allowing the authority to intervene earlier, particularly against huge digital companies.
The watchdog has also classified Meta, the company that owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, as a company of “paramount significance across markets”.

409,"June 20, 2022","Japan May Fine Twitter, Meta, Google Over Domestic Registration","


The Japanese government is set to levy fines against 48 tech companies including Twitter, Facebook- owner Meta Platforms and Alphabet Inc’s Google for failing to register their headquarters in the country, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Monday.
In early June, the Ministry of Justice reiterated its request that some companies register their global headquarters in Japan by June 13. The ministry said that it would ask courts to fine the companies if they still have no intention of registering.
If IT companies have their headquarters registered in Japan, consumers would have an easier time filing lawsuits when problems, such as defamation on social media websites, occur. The government believes proper registration is essential to protect consumers.
Japan’s corporate code requires overseas companies doing business in the country on a continuous basis to register a headquarters in Japan. Overseas IT companies maintain that they are providing their services through the internet and are not continuously developing their business by establishing bases in Japan. These companies also appear to have insisted they believe it is enough to register their Japan-based units, such as those handling marketing operations.

410,"March 9, 2022",Amazon Switches Whole Foods Gig Workers To Employees,"
Amazon, like many companies, has been changing its policies over the past few years in an attempt to capture the growing number of consumers who have apparently ditched physical supermarkets, preferring to make their grocery shopping online, CNBC wrote Tuesday, March 8.
Amid increased competition from Walmart, other supermarket chains and apps like Instacart and DoorDash, Amazon is preparing to streamline its own operations, increasing both the company’s legendary efficiency, as well as improving in other aspects of the business such as logistics and personnel management. 
In late February, Amazon announced to the workers who select and prepare items for deliver that they would soon be offered a new position, working for the company’s Whole Foods division under formal employment contracts according to a letter seen by CNBC.
The company will offer these gig workers a position as Whole Foods employees with longer shifts, as opposed to keeping them as gig workers. Per the report, schedules will be made “up to three weeks” ahead of time and will cover two-week periods. This goes against Amazon’s previous statements, which claimed that “shift flexibility” and the ability to work as little as four hours a week would be among the perks received by employees.

“To help continue to offer the best experience for our team and customers, we are transitioning online grocery-fulfillment operations currently operated by Amazon to Whole Foods Market by the end of the year,” the company said in its letter to employees. “This transition will happen slowly for the majority of stores.”
The change is the latest step Amazon has made to simplify its sprawling grocery and physical retail operations, including its two supermarket chains, several convenience stores and apparel stores.
Amazon also announced recently that it was closing down all its physical bookstores in an attempt to focus more on its grocery store operations, including Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market and Amazon Go.

Amazon is putting pressure on the Federal Trade Commission to deliver a verdict on its proposed $8.45 billion acquisition of MGM, reported the Wall Street Journal. 
Amazon recently certified to the FTC that it had provided all the information requested by antitrust investigators, according to the Journal. That certification triggered a mid-March deadline for the FTC, the report said, citing anonymous sources. 
Related: FTC Gears Up For Potential Challenge To Amazon’s $8.5B MGM Takeover
Such a short deadline could prove difficult to meet for the FTC, allowing Amazon to close the deal. In this scenario, Amazon wouldn’t necessarily be clear of the threat of an FTC action, however. The commission still has the ability to challenge mergers and acquisitions after they close.
In recent months, the FTC has warned some companies that their deals may remain under investigation even after the legally mandated waiting period has expired. This, among other signals of tighter oversight over Big Tech mergers in general, has become a salient aspect of the Biden administration’s tougher antitrust approach. 
The shift has been criticized by some commentators for adding a degree of uncertainty to merger transactions, especially those that become politically unpopular. 
Amazon, which has been the focus of a long-running investigation into the company’s business practices, as well as a probe into the MGM deal, could fall into that category. The FTC could also file suit, at which point the merger outcome would be determined by antitrust litigation that could go on for months or years.
Amazon’s purchase of MGM has drawn opposition from both politicians and labor organizations, concerned that the acquisition of a major film studio will increase Amazon’s ability to leverage its power in the Streaming Video-On-Demand market, possibly harming consumers, rival competitors, and film industry workers.

413,"March 1, 2022",FTC Gears Up For Potential Challenge To Amazon’s $8.5B MGM Takeover,"



The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is gearing up for a potential antitrust lawsuit challenging Amazon’s $8.5 billion takeover of MGM Studios, the Information reported on Monday.
Amazon’s interest in the movie studio coincides with the rise of streaming platforms and services that have grown to become one of the largest sources of entertainment and audiovisual content for US and European audiences. 
Amazon’s own streaming service, Amazon Prime Video, has quickly positioned itself as a significant competitor to streaming giant Netflix, alongside traditional film and television studios that have joined the streaming bandwagon, including Disney, Warner Media’sHBO, or Paramount studios.

The FTC is exploring actions, including hiring expert witnesses to appear in an eventual trial. The FTC will decide whether to bring the case in the next few weeks. 

The move would be the latest in the ongoing FTC review of Amazon’s planned purchase of the US movie studio, home to the “James Bond” franchise. The deal was announced in May last year, swiftly followed by the FTC’s warnings of a potential investigation. 
The deal’s high visibility has been seen by some commentators as a reason for the FTC’s interest in the deal, sending a clear signal to the Silicon Valley tech giant that it can expect all major deals to be met with some level of regulatory pushback. 
In June, Amazon had filed a petition asking for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who has been a vocal Amazon critic, to be recused on antitrust matters related to the online retail giant because of her previous work while at an antitrust advocacy group, public statements and work for a congressional subcommittee.
The market for streaming content has grown rapidly in recent years, boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic’s various lockdowns and restrictions that limited entertainment options for much of the world’s population. Once dominated by the likes of Netflix, multiple platforms now compete in the market.

There’s no guarantee the tech giant will follow through with an offer or that Peloton, which is working with its own advisers, would be receptive to an approach. Other potential suitors are circling, the WSJ reported, though no deal is imminent.

Amazon and Peloton declined to comment on both papers and Nike didn’t immediately respond to the FT’s request for comment.
Peloton was a darling of the pandemic as people at home during lockdowns turned to its fitness bikes and online classes for exercise. But shares have fallen more than 80% from their high a year ago as the gradual easing of pandemic restrictions fueled concern that growth would slow. Activist investor Blackwells Capital last month issued a letter demanding the company fire co-founder and Chief Executive Officer John Foley and pursue a sale. Blackwells said in the letter that potential buyers could include Apple Inc., Walt Disney Co., and Nike.

417,"February 2, 2022",India’s Fair Market Regulator Needs to Define What is the Market Sin it has Penalized Amazon For,"
By Subhomoy Bhattacharjee1
 
When France and Germany went to war in 1870, a London newspaper pithily remarked “The Liberal Empire goes to war on a mere point of etiquette.” The order issued by the Competition Commission of India2 against Amazon revoking its acquisition of 49 percent in Future Coupons Private Limited (“FCPL”) in 2019 seems to be similarly based somewhat on a question of etiquette.
Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC (“Amazon”), a direct subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc, and India’s Future Group, operating in the retail and fashion sector have presented competing claims before the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”).  Amazon has claimed3 the fair market regulator made a mistake in approving FCPL’s sale of its retail assets housed in Future Retail Limited (“FRL”) to a company owned by Reliance Industries (“RIL”) for US$ 3.4 billion. According to the US-based multinational technology company, the approval was “illegally obtained” since a previous order exists against the finalization of the deal, issued by a Singapore arbitration court.
FCPL has, in turn, contended4 that Amazon filed “false and incorrect information” to acquire the 49 percent stake in FCPL. For context, FCPL is the primary shareholder of FRL, holding a 9.82 percent equity. The key point of the dispute was whether FCPL should get prior approval from Amazon before exercising any rights over FRL, essentially a Right of First Refusal clause.
At this stage, it is not my intention to question whether Amazon has disclosed all that is material in the case with CCI or anyone else. The same holds true regarding its competitor, RIL. Rather, this paper analyzes only the documents made publicly available in the respective cases.
The fast-growing retail sector in India has become a highly sought-after space for Indian and foreign businesses to expand their presence. The struggle between Amazon and RIL is the most visible manifestation of this competition.
The CCI has upheld FCPL’s argument that Amazon had “suppressed the actual purpose and particulars of the combination.” In issuing its order the Commission noted Amazon’s original application had “omissions, false statements and misrepresentations (which) have the effect of influencing the line of inquiry in assessing the Combination.”
Consequently, the CCI has:

revoked its approval of the combination between Amazon and FCPL which was given on 28th November 2019;
asked Amazon to refile its application within 60 days of the new order “with true, correct and complete information”; and
imposed a penalty of Rs two hundred and two crores (Rs 2.02 billion) on Amazon.

Whatever the position of the contestants, one of the highlights of the dispute pitching Amazon against RIL is that it has again come back to be settled by the CCI. This is where it should have been from the beginning, since August 2020, when RIL’s  branch Reliance Retail Ventures Limited announced the buy-out of FRL’s retail business. Soon thereafter, however, Amazon moved to contest the deal at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. An interim decision was passed by the Emergency Arbitrator in Singapore in favor of Amazon, preventing FRL from moving forward on the deal with the RIL-owned company.
In response, the Future Group also turned to the courts in order to nullify the arbitration orders. There were competing court cases at the Delhi High Court and at the Supreme Court.
  
CCI Purview
At its core, the dispute between Amazon on one side, and FRL and RIL on the other, should be about market share and the possible formation of cartels, basically the possibility of an anti-competitive behavior.  However, in its 57-page order issued 17th December, 2021 the CCI only provided reams of text to prove that Amazon had “concealed its strategic interest over FRL.” Principally, it has argued that Amazon did not disclose FRL’s shareholders agreement, which apparently gave Amazon an overriding presence in FCPL. This is what I call an issue of etiquette, which has riled CCI. While the CCI is within its rights to demand all sorts of documents in order to issue a decision on a proposed combination, if they do not establish the reasons why the absence hurts the market and consumer welfare, the regulator has no basis for passing any order.
Under the Competition Act, the CCI’s rationale for examining any case is only supposed to be anti-competitive behavior. It is not a court of law, and therefore is not able to examine evidence from any other point of view. This is the basis, as one understands, even for its power to impose penalties for furnishing false or incomplete information on a transaction, under Sections 44 and 45 of the Competition Act, as in this case.
An examination of how “strategic” Amazon’s interest in FRL is should therefore be linked specifically to the use of penalties to impact the market. For instance, when the capital market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“Sebi”) examines any charge of insider trading (the highest offence under its purview) or that of misguiding investors, it does so with reference to the integrity of the market. The government has, for instance, denied Sebi the power to tap phones5 and other similar activities, leaving those up to the tax authorities and other prosecuting agencies. Penalties are therefore monetary, while issues of fraud and other related problems are dealt with by the courts.
The Sebi order in the Sahara case is a fine example in this respect:
“The Board as a regulator has been assigned a statutory duty to protect the integrity of the securities market and the interests of investors in securities, apart from promoting the development of and regulating the market by such measures as it may deem fit.  It is in the discharge of this statutory obligation that the Board has framed the Regulations, with a view to keeping the marketplace safe for investors to invest by keeping undesirable elements out.”6
Nowhere in the CCI order does it mention what material damage to the market was being investigated in this case. The Commission has not gone into whether the submission of additional documents was necessary to understand the supposed market power that shall be garnered by either Amazon or FCPL.
Instead, it argues, as follows:
“Through these transactions, Amazon Group wanted to secure its ability to become the single largest shareholder of FRL when foreign direct investment opens up in the retail sector; preclude/ block competitive interest in FRL, and utilize FRL’s pan-Indian store infrastructure to bolster their ultra-fast delivery program, exclusively carry private-label portfolio in grocery and value fashion; and drive fees for Amazon.”
All of the above are objectives that a company can legitimately have. More significantly, these do not denote any anti-competitive behavior. What, then, is the misdemeanor being pursued by the CCI in the order delivered on December 17, 2021?
In determining its approval of the investment by Amazon into FCPL, the CCI was supposed to stitch all the information Amazon offered, considering whether said information or facts were a) materially different from what it had offered earlier, and b) whether they would have hurt the market adversely. Incidentally, para. 12 of the CCI order did recognize the overlap of Amazon’s business with FRL7.  In other words, the question was whether the combination had the potential to affect the operation of a fair market.
To provide further context, the acquisition of FCPL by Amazon in 2019, and by the RIL subsidiary of FRL in 2020 were both cleared by CCI. While the two acquirers had offered different reasons for their respective transactions, the CCI, surprisingly made no mention of the first one in its second order. In para. 42 of the second order, CCI had recognized the presence of Amazon in the B2B marketplace in India, among others, as a competition constraint. Yet it had found no reason to contextualize the second order.
Incidentally, in the case of RIL subsidiary RRVL’s takeover of FRL, while the RIL entities had clearly stated the market where the combined entity would operate as being the one for business-to-business sales in India (the same market where Amazon got its license to operate). However, CCI’s order was regarding the B2C segments. In paragraphs 25, 29, 31, and 33 of the order, the regulator notes8 that the parties have averred “that the relevant product market may be considered as the market for the overall retail market and alternatively as the markets for retail of (i) F&G; (ii) AFA; and (iii) GM…The retail market in India comprises large brick-and-mortar stores, online retailers, mom and pop stores, kirana stores, etc. These offer the same or similar products to end consumers and compete inter-se. There is presence of retail hubs such as haats, mandis, bazaars, and cluster markets (“Local Hubs”). Largely, the stores can be said to fall under the unorganized or the organized segments. All kinds of retail products (like grocery, apparel, general merchandise, etc.) are sold through both organized and unorganized segment stores.” Comparing the size of this retail universe to the proposed merger, the Commission “decided to leave the delineation of the relevant market open as it was observed that the Proposed Combination is not likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition in any of the possible alternative relevant markets.” The assessment does look all over the place.
This brings us the need to define “consumer welfare.” The CCI has always shied away from a definition of consumer welfare. In other words, has there been any welfare loss for the economy? It has instead pursued market share as evidence of anti-competitive behavior, as it has done in the case of Google. If the charge is of suppressing “strategic interests” in FRL, that should have been served by referring the same to other government agencies like the Enforcement Directorate. The latter has already summoned both the companies for a hearing on the same.
Finally, in order to face a legal challenge for which there is essentially no precedent and very little jurisprudence to guide its work, the CCI will be handling this most sensitive analysis when the post of adviser (law) in the Commission is vacant. It has put out an advertisement to fill this position.

418,"January 26, 2022",AG Ferguson Probe Shutsdown “Sold By Amazon”,"


Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced on Wednesday, January 26, that, as a result of his office’s price-fixing investigation, Amazon will shut down the “Sold by Amazon” program nationwide.
The Attorney General’s Office simultaneously filed a suit and a legally binding resolution in King County Superior Court. As part of the legally enforceable consent decree, Amazon must stop the “Sold by Amazon” program nationwide and provide the Attorney General’s Office with annual updates on its compliance with antitrust laws. In addition, Amazon will pay US$2.25 million to the Attorney General’s Office, which will be used to support the Attorney General’s antitrust enforcement, which does not receive general fund support.
The “Sold by Amazon” program allowed the online retailer to agree on price with third-party sellers, rather than compete with them. Ferguson’s lawsuit asserted that the program violated antitrust laws. Amazon unreasonably restrained competition in order to maximize its own profits off third-party sales. This conduct constituted unlawful price-fixing.
Amazon offered the “Sold by Amazon” program from 2018 through 2020 on an invitation-only basis. It invited several hundred third-party sellers with whom it had previously competed for online consumer sales on its online marketplace and other e-commerce platforms.
“Consumers lose when corporate giants like Amazon fix prices to increase their profits,” Ferguson said. “Today’s action promotes product innovation and consumer choice, and makes the market more competitive for sellers in Washington state and across the country.”
There are about 2.3 million third-party sellers on Amazon worldwide, according to information from a 2018 Amazon letter to its shareholders. Over the last two decades, Amazon’s sales of its own branded products grew from US$1.6 billion in 1999 to US$117 billion in 2018. Over that same period, third-party sales grew exponentially from US$100 million in 1999 to US$160 billion in 2018. Third-party sales account for over half the sales on Amazon.
Washington state ranks among the top 10 states in the nation with the fastest growing rate of third-party sellers on its online marketplace.

On Thursday a Russian court said it had sent state bailiffs to enforce the collection of $238,845 in fines imposed on US social media giant Facebook for failing to delete content that Russia deems illegal.
According to Reuters, Moscow’s Tagansky District Court issued the order over four fines that Facebook has not paid, the court said in a statement, the second time this month it has sought the assistance of bailiffs in bringing Facebook to heel.

421,"October 20, 2021",UK Fines Facebook $69M For Breaching Order During Giphy Probe,"
Social media giant Facebook has been fined £50.5 million (US$69.1 million) for breaching an order imposed by the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) during its ongoing investigation into Facebook’s purchase of Giphy.
The previously completed merger of Facebook and Giphy, the largest provider of GIFs and meme sharing services, ran into a potential roadblock from the CMA earlier this year. The CMA provisionally found that the merger would negatively impact competition between social media platforms, something that Facebook disagrees with.
Facebook is required, as part of the process, to provide the CMA with regular updates outlining its compliance with the IEO. Facebook significantly limited the scope of those updates, despite repeated warnings from the CMA.
The compliance reports are crucial to ensure that the CMA has oversight of the companies’ behaviour, including whether Facebook has been taking any action which might prejudice the outcome of its investigation.
“It is standard practice to issue an initial enforcement order (IEO) at the start of an investigation into a completed acquisition. This ensures that companies continue to compete with each other as they would have without the merger, and prevents the companies involved from integrating further while a merger investigation is ongoing,” the CMA said in a statement. “The CMA imposed this type of order on Facebook in June 2020 in relation to its purchase of Giphy.”

Facebook’s six-hour outage the previous day shows the repercussions of relying on just a few big players and underscores the need for more rivals, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Tuesday, October 5.
The outage prevented the company’s 3.5 billion users from accessing its social media and messaging services such as WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger, the largest ever tracked by web monitoring group Downdetector. read more
Droves of users switched to competing apps such as Twitter and TikTok on Monday. Several Facebook employees who declined to be named told Reuters that they believed that the outage was caused by an internal mistake in how internet traffic is routed to its systems.
The incident showed the need for more competition, Vestager wrote on Twitter. “We need alternatives and choices in the tech market, and must not rely on a few big players, whoever they are, that’s the aim of (the) DMA,” she tweeted.
#facebookdown tells 2 things :1/ we need alternatives & choices in the #tech market, and must not rely on a few big players, whoever they are => that’s the aim of #DMA2/ that sometimes, there’s nothing better than talking to each other… just on the phone or … offline?— Margrethe Vestager (@vestager) October 5, 2021 
Vestager last year proposed draft rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) that sets out a list of dos and don’ts for Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google that in essence will force them to change their core business model to allow more competition.
EU lawmakers and EU countries are now debating their own proposals and will need to reconcile the three drafts before the tech rules come into force.

424,"October 5, 2021",Blumenthal Says Facebook Whistleblower’s Allegations Should Be Probed By Regulators,"


US lawmakers questioned Facebook on Tuesday, October 5, accusing Zuckerberg of pushing for higher profits while ignoring  user safety, reported Reuters. They  also demanded that regulators investigate whistleblower accusations that the social media company harms children and stokes divisions.
Coming a day after Facebook and its units including Instagram suffered an outage, whistleblower Frances Haugen testified in a congressional hearing that “for more than five hours Facebook wasn’t used to deepen divides, destabilize democracies and make young girls and women feel bad about their bodies.” 
In an opening statement to a Senate Commerce subcommittee, chair Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said Facebook knew that its products were addictive, like cigarettes. “Tech now faces that big tobacco jawdropping moment of truth,” he said.
He called for Zuckerberg to testify before the committee, and for the Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Trade Commission to investigate the company.
“Our children are the ones who are victims. Teens today looking in the mirror feel doubt and insecurity. Mark Zuckerberg ought to be looking at himself in the mirror,” Blumenthal said, adding that Zuckerberg instead was going sailing.
Haugen, a former product manager on Facebook’s civic misinformation team who has turned whistleblower, said Facebook has sought to keep its operations confidential.
“Today, no regulator has a menu of solutions for how to fix Facebook, because Facebook didn’t want them to know enough about what’s causing the problems. Otherwise, there wouldn’t have been need for a whistleblower,” she said.
The top Republican on the subcommittee, Marsha Blackburn, said that Facebook turned a blind eye to children below age 13 on its sites. “It is clear that Facebook prioritizes profit over the well-being of children and all users.”
Facebook spokesman Kevin McAlister wrote in an email ahead of the hearing that the company sees protecting its community as more important than maximizing profits and stated it was not accurate that leaked internal research demonstrated that Instagram was “toxic” for teenage girls.

425,"October 4, 2021",Facebook Asks Court To Dismiss FTC’s Amended Complaint,"


Facebook on Monday filed a motion to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s amended antitrust complaint against the social network, reported The New York Times.
The amended complaint, filed in August, is focused on the social media giant’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, accusing Facebook of unlawfully maintaining its dominance by acquiring or eliminating companies it sees as competitive threats.
In June, US District Judge James Boasberg dismissed an earlier antitrust complaint filed by the FTC, saying the agency hadn’t provided enough evidence that Facebook has monopoly power in personal social networking.
Facebook on Monday said the amended complaint should “suffer the same fate,” arguing that the FTC can’t credibly claim the social network has monopoly power.
“The FTC’s fictional market ignores the competitive reality: Facebook competes vigorously with TikTok, iMessage, Twitter, Snapchat, LinkedIn, YouTube, and countless others to help people share, connect, communicate or simply be entertained,” said a Facebook spokesperson in an emailed statement. “We continuously innovate and improve our products and services to earn people’s time and attention because we have to.”

426,"September 30, 2021",Facebook Questions Attorneys Working On A Prospective Antitrust Class Action,"


Lawyers for Facebook on Wednesday, September 29, questioned the number of plaintiffs’ attorneys working on a prospective antitrust class action, suggesting “inefficiencies” could grow as the case moves forward.
The company’s legal team at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr raised its concerns in a jointly filed submission with the plaintiffs lawyers ahead of a status conference in federal court in San Jose, California. The lawsuit, filed in December 2020, alleges Facebook duped consumers about data privacy as part of the company’s bid to monopolize the social media market.
Wilmer Hale attorneys, including partner Sonal Mehta, said plaintiffs firms are “consistently” staffing 12 to 14 lawyers despite “only a handful speaking or participating in any way” on phone calls among counsel addressing issues in the lawsuit. Facebook said it thought it was “prudent” to raise “potential (in)efficiency of the interim class counsel structure.”
Facebook also stated “plaintiffs have had multiple lawyers sending emails to Facebook on the same subject.” Still, the company also stated it “recognizes that it does not have a role” in how the plaintiffs’ lawyers devise their responsibilities.
Plaintiffs’ lawyers at the firms Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro are leading the representation of the putative consumer class, and the firms Bathaee Dunne and Scott + Scott represent a would-be advertiser class.
In the joint court filing, the plaintiffs’ lawyers derided Facebook’s observations about efficiency as “aspersions.”

The UK’s competition watchdog has cleared Facebook’s acquisition of Kustomer, a maker of CRM tools.
The purchase was announced last November,  with a price tag we reported as US$1 billion, but is pending closing after facing regulatory scrutiny.
The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened an inquiry on the proposed merger this summer, at the end of July. The European Commission has also been digging into the implications of the deal, opening an investigation in August.
In a summary of its decision to greenlight Facebook’s latest bit of B2B shopping, the CMA stated it looked at whether letting Facebook go ahead and scoop up the customer service software maker would dent competition by raising barriers to entry in the online display advertising market; whether Facebook might harm the competitiveness of customer service tools maker by limiting or degrading their access to its messaging channels; whether the tech giant might harm the competitiveness of other B2C messaging services by preventing them from integrating with Kustomer’s services; and whether Facebook could rely on cross-subsidizing from its online ads business to undercut competitors by offering Kustomer for free or on a freemium basis, thereby undermining the ability of others to compete.

Italy’s data protection authority announced on Friday, September 9, it has asked Facebook to provide clarifications over the social media giant’s newly launched smart glasses to assess whether the product is compliant with privacy laws.
Facebook smart glasses, which were created in partnership with Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica, allow wearers to listen to music, take calls, or capture photos and short videos and share them across Facebook’s services using a companion app. 
The Italian watchdog, Garante, stated it has called on the Irish data protection commissioner, which leads oversight of Facebook because the social-media company’s European headquarters are based in Ireland, to ask Facebook for clarifications.
The Italian authority stated it wanted to be informed on measures Facebook has put in place to protect people occasionally filmed, in particular children, as well as on systems adopted to make data collected anonymous and features of the voice assistant connected to the glasses.
“We know people have questions about new technologies, so before the launch of Ray-Ban Stories we engaged with the Irish DPC to share how we’ve built privacy into the product design and functionality of the glasses to give both device owners and people around them peace of mind,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement.
“We’ll answer questions from Garante through the Irish DPC and we look forward to our continued collaboration with regulators in Europe,” the spokesperson added.

430,"March 20, 2022",Apple Looks To Delay Implementation Of EU App Store Bill,"


Apple is facing regulatory headwinds that may threaten its App Store revenue. However, the Cupertino, California-based company still has some legal arguments that could help it to delay the implementation of one of the most far-reaching provisions in the European Commission’s Digital Markets Act (DMA). 
The European Union approved the DMA in late 2021, aiming to increase competition between digital platforms by limiting what some BigTech companies can do. New requirements set out in the bill will force Apple to allow software to be downloaded outside its money-making App Store and to allow companies to use other payment systems on apps. 
Related: The Digital Markets Act (DMA): A Procompetitive Recalibration of Data Relations?
The law is expected to be approved by all the European institutions before summer, and will likely be enforced six months after it is passed. Thus, Apple should, in theory, start complying with these requirements by the end of 2022 or beginning of 2023. 
However, Apple has fought any attempt so far to open up its App Store to third parties. For instance, in South-Korea, Apple challenged a new regulation that ordered the tech giant to loosen its grip over the app economy. In the Netherlands, the company has chosen to pay a $5 million weekly fine rather than complying with a decision from the competition authority that asked Apple to allow other apps to use other payment methods in the App Store. 
The reason for Apple to push back on these obligations is not only financial — 20% of Apple’s annual operating income comes from the App Store — but also because by complying, it may weaken its own privacy and safety arguments to keep its system closed. Besides, Apple is facing a similar legislative threat in the US, the Open App Markets Act, which is on its way to the Senate floor for a vote, and any concession in Europe or elsewhere about the App Store may have repercussions in the US.

Sports car maker Porsche and tech giant Apple Inc. talked last year about potential joint projects, Porsche Chief Executive Oliver Blume said Friday (March 18) during the company’s annual earnings call, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Executives from Porsche came to the U.S. late last year for meetings with Apple and other tech companies about potential collaborations, said Blume.
“We already have Apple CarPlay,” he said of the software that connects iPhones to most new cars. “We will expand on that. We discussed a range of exciting projects with the Apple [executives].”
Porsche’s parent company, Volkswagen AG, plans to take the German car company public later this year, the report says. Apple didn’t respond to WSJ’s request for comment.
Blume, Porsche Chief Financial Officer Lutz Meschke and other Porsche board members met with undisclosed Apple executives in November at the Los Angeles Auto Show, a person familiar with the situation told WSJ, adding no particulars or negotiations were discussed during the session.
“There is nothing specific at this point,” the person said. “It had nothing to do with a car. They talked about various digital projects.”
Apple has been exploring ways to move beyond CarPlay since 2014, including a consideration of designing its own car, people familiar with the efforts have said, according to the report. It explored manufacturing partners and suppliers with the hopes of beginning production by 2024, the report says.
Hyundai Motor Group said it was talking with Apple early last year, but those discussions ended without a deal. Speculation around the South Korean companies heated up in earlier last year when Kia seemed to indicate it was going to develop batteries with Apple. Several Apple managers left the company, including Doug Field, who left for a senior role at Ford Motor Co.

432,"March 2, 2022",Apple Challenges Attorneys’ Fees In Developer Settlement,"


In a court filing submitted on Monday, Apple Inc. challenged a plaintiff counsel’s request for 30.5% of the $100 million settlement awarded to a group of software developers, as compensation for both expenses and legal fees. Apple argues that the expenses and service awards are reasonable, but the request for 27% attorneys’ fees may be too high based on the standards applied in the Ninth Circuit and in the Northern District of California.
The case dates back to 2019, when mobile app developers sued Apple for antitrust violations, contending that the company acquired and maintained monopoly power by refusing to allow iOS device users to purchase iOS apps and in-app products other than through its own App Store. 
The parties reached a settlement during the class certification briefing and presented it to the court in August. In November, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. Apple has continued to battle other developers and authorities over the terms it offers to developers who wish to offer their products on Apple’s IOS App Store. 
Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers opined that the agreement, which provides for both monetary relief and “structural changes that will benefit all developers worldwide for at least three years after final approval” was fair. 
The court reminded plaintiffs’ counsel that a 33% award was atypical in such cases and “any request for the same will need to be accompanied by detailed time records.”
Apple responded to the motion for attorneys’ fees by acknowledging that “[c]lass counsel are entitled to be paid for their efforts in litigating this action. The question is how much.” The thrust of the company’s argument centered on both the benefit for the developer class, as well as Ninth Circuit precedent dictating that “class counsel should be awarded 25 percent of the ascertainable value of a settlement as attorney’s fees.”

Apple has written a letter arguing that the changes it has offered to make to its App Store as available in the Netherlands complies with the law, despite the fact that the antitrust regulator has rejected the proposal as ‘not serious’, reported Reuters.
Apple sent a letter to the Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) arguing it has already complied with the watchdog’s order. However, the ACM said in a statement it was not aware of any change in Apple’s position and imposed a new fine, marking the sixth such fine imposed on Apple in as many weeks. 
Related: On Dutch Apple Fine, Vestager Says US Tech Giants May Prefer Fines To Compliance
Apple’s practice of requiring developers to use its system exclusively and pay commissions of between 15 and 30% on digital goods purchases has come under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world, many of whom have considered these policies as forms of barriers to entry, thwarting possible competitors and solidifying Apple’s strong position in the App distribution markets worldwide. 
The Dutch ruling, which found the company is abusing a dominant market position, applies only in the Netherlands and only for dating apps. However, it could set a precedent for jurisdictions analyzing similar cases. Many experts and commentators have warned of a possible stifling of innovation due to these practices, raising interest among regulators. 
The watchdog had already levied five separate weekly $5.7 million fines against Apple for failure to comply with the order, saying that Apple’s proposed solutions put an unfair burden on developers.
A letter from Apple to the ACM dated Feb. 28 seen by Reuters said the solution it has offered would require only a “minor technical change” with no additional costs. The letter argued it is common practice for developers to modify their software to comply with law in various jurisdictions.

434,"February 23, 2022","On Dutch Apple Fine, Vestager Says US Tech Giants May Prefer Fines To Compliance","


The European Union’s head of digital policy, EVP Margrethe Vestager, has hit out at Apple, suggesting the company is deliberately choosing to pay fines to avoid compliance with a Dutch antitrust order requiring it to allow dating apps to make use of third party payment tech when selling in-app content, reported The Global and Mail.
On Monday the tech giant racked up a fifth penalty payment of €5M in the Netherlands, bringing its total fine to date from the Dutch competition authority over this issue to €25M — still with no compliance in sight.
European Commission Vice-President and digital chief Margrethe Vestager said Apple’s behaviour could indicate other big companies behave similarly.
“Some gatekeepers may be tempted to play for time or try to circumvent the rules,” she said in an online speech at a U.S. awards ceremony on Tuesday.
“Apple’s conduct in the Netherlands these days may be an example. As we understand it, Apple essentially prefers paying periodic fines, rather than comply with a decision of the Dutch Competition Authority on the terms and conditions for third parties to access its App Store.”
The Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) said Apple abused its dominant market position by not allowing software applications in the Netherlands to use any other payment modes. The company had a Jan. 15 deadlines to comply with the ACM, but didn’t do so.
Apple argues it had complied with the ACM ruling by letting dating app makers submit a new app with alternative payment methods enabled. The company also says it still plans to charge a 27% commission on any in-app payments it doesn’t process — a slight drop from the 30% it charges now.

435,"February 21, 2022",Apple’s App Store Under Scrutiny From US Bipartisan Lawmakers,"


US Bipartisan lawmakers are worried about how Apple runs its App Store and currently the tech giant is defending against legislation that would loosen its supremacy, The Wall Street Journal writes.
According to PYMNTS, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 20-2 this month on legislation that could erode fees Apple collects on digital app revenues. This all happened in spite of calls to senators and Apple’s warnings that this would be detrimental to privacy and security.
The bill is backed by a loose alliance of Apple’s rivals like Epic Games and Microsoft. It will offer a middle ground for lawmakers who want to curb big tech power but can’t reach a consensus for regulating social media.
The report says the Senate leaders’ focus on Apple marks a shift from the strategy employed previously by Congress, which had been focused on Amazon’s treatment of retailers, Google’s ad business control, and other such issues.
“For a long time, Apple floated above the fray in Washington,” said Paul Gallant, a policy analyst with Cowen & Co, adding that the company has now “been pulled down into the muck.”
The app store bill is just one front in the war Apple is waging against rivals challenging its control of the app economy — and access to the over one billion users of its devices.
Earlier this month, Apple was fined 5 million euros by Dutch antitrust regulators because of an order to open up app payments for dating services.

Apple asserts in posts on its websites that it has complied with the ACM’s December ruling that found the company was abusing a dominant market position.
The Dutch watchdog said the company’s apparent concessions put “unnecessary and unreasonable” conditions on dating app developers.
It singled out as problematic a requirement by Apple that the app developers that want to use non-Apple payment methods – which include Tinder owner Match Group – would have to submit a new app to the App Store to do so, and then convince customers to switch.
Apple, which says non-Apple payment methods pose a security risk to customers, did not respond to requests for comment.
Apple on Jan 15 first asserted it had complied with the Dutch regulator’s decision. But the regulator responded that the company had not made changes – it had just indicated it would.

Apple, which could not immediately be reached for comment, has twice published information on its own blog about changes it is making to comply with the Dutch order.

“ACM is disappointed in Apple’s behaviour and actions,” it said in a statement. It noted that Dutch courts have upheld its decision, which found that Apple’s behaviour violated competition law.
Apple is under pressure in many countries over the commissions it charges on in-app purchases, with the U.S. Senate approving a bill last Thursday that would bar Apple and Alphabet Inc’s Google from requiring users to use their payment systems.

440,"April 8, 2021",UK Software Firm Launches Antitrust Suit Against Microsoft,"


UK-based pre-owned software license reseller ValueLicensing has filed a lawsuit in the London High Court against Microsoft for abusing its dominant position in the European markets to restrict resale of perpetual licenses for Windows and other company products, reported TechRadar.
In its claim, ValueLicensing calls into question certain contractual practices employed by Microsoft, which it contends have stifled the supply of pre-owned Microsoft licenses in the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA). 
The license reseller argues Microsoft’s contractual practices go against the spirit of a 2012 European Court ruling that allowed the resale of perpetual licenses bought within the EEA as long as they are for an unlimited period.
The controversial clause, which ValueLicensing claims has been in force since at least 2016, forces organizations to agree not to resale their perpetual licenses in order to get a bulk discount. 
It argues that with the clause Microsoft has abused its dominant position in the market to undermine the activities of its reseller rivals and has allowed the Redmond-based software giant to assume a monopolistic position.
“In purchasing software, public and private-sector organizations presently have little option but to move to subscriptions offered by Microsoft, because there are so few preowned perpetual licenses available now, as a result of Microsoft’s campaign to almost entirely drain the market,” said ValueLicensing’s founder and managing director, Jonathan Horley.
ValueLicensing is asking the High Court in London to award damages for the losses it has suffered as a result of Microsoft’s conduct, to the tune of £270 million (US$371 million).

Microsoft’s multibillion-dollar deal to build customized versions of its HoloLens goggles for the US Army is moving forward, one year after the Senate considered freezing half the contract, reported Bloomberg.
The deal, initially unveiled three years ago, is now worth as much as $21.9 billion over 10 years, according to Microsoft. The agreement runs for an initial five years, with an option to add another five years. The software maker will manufacture the augmented-reality devices in the US The Army announced the contract Wednesday on its website.

The system would let commanders project information onto a visor in front of a soldier’s face, and would include other features such as night vision.

Microsoft is in talks to buy messaging platform Discord for more than US$10 billion, Bloomberg News reported.
Discord has reached out to potential buyers and Microsoft is one of them, according to the report which cited people familiar with the matter. One person said it was more likely to go public than sell itself.
Discord, which is valued at around US$7 billion as of last December, is a platform on which users coordinate group activities such as games, discussions, and even virtual parties.
The Xbox maker has been seeking to strengthen its video game offerings with US$7.5 billion acquisition of ZeniMax Media last year, its biggest gaming acquisition ever.
The COVID-19 pandemic has boosted the prospects of gaming companies as people stayed at home and turned to video games for entertainment during lockdowns.
With its strong gaming business, Microsoft has also been looking to own mass social media platforms. Its last big social media deal was the US$26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn in 2016, while it failed in its bid for short video app TikTok’s US assets in September last year.

Microsoft’s professional networking site LinkedIn, one of the few US social networks available to mainland Chinese users, is pausing new member registrations in the country as the company works to ensure it remains in compliance with national law.
“We’re a global platform with an obligation to respect the laws that apply to us, including adhering to Chinese government regulations for our localised version of LinkedIn in China,” Microsoft stated according to The Wall Street Journal.
LinkedIn, which entered China in 2014, is a rare example of a US social network that remains accessible within the country, where a government-built firewall blocks nearly all of the platform’s popular peers, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and, most recently, the live-audio chat app Clubhouse.
Instead, China has cultivated its own social media ecosystem consisting of the likes of microblogging site Weibo and messaging app WeChat for its more than 900 million internet users. Home-grown professional networking platforms such as Maimai – LinkedIn’s biggest rival in China – have also attracted a considerable number of users.

445,"March 12, 2021",Microsoft & Google Spar Over Treatment Of News Outlets At Subcommittee Hearing,"


Microsoft and Google sparred Friday over their practices and treatment of news outlets in a battle between antitrust targets of past and present, reported CNBC.
In his written testimony for a hearing before the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust Friday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said Google has made journalism outlets dependent upon its vast array of services, including analytics and advertising tools, while profiting from access to their content. Smith said Google relies on content from these outlets to keep its users engaged, citing his own experience with Microsoft’s Bing search engine.
Smith said referral traffic from Google has real value to news outlets, but “monetizing that traffic has become increasingly difficult for news organizations because most of the profit has been squeezed out by Google.” He pointed to a steep decline in newspaper advertising revenue from $49.4 billion in 2005 to $14.3 billion in 2018, according to Pew Research. Over the same period, he said, Google’s ad revenue grew from $6.1 billion to $116 billion.
“This is not a coincidence,” he said.
Google swung back at Smith in a statement released ahead of the hearing, calling back to Microsoft’s period of antitrust scrutiny two decades ago.
“We respect Microsoft’s success and we compete hard with them in cloud computing, search, productivity apps, video conferencing, email and many other areas,” Google’s senior vice president of Global Affairs Kent Walker said in a blog post. “Unfortunately, as competition in these areas intensifies, they are reverting to their familiar playbook of attacking rivals and lobbying for regulations that benefit their own interests.”
“They are now making self-serving claims and are even willing to break the way the open web works in an effort to undercut a rival,” Walker wrote. “And their claims about our business and how we work with news publishers are just plain wrong.”

Christian Van Thillo, a Belgian media executive who is chair of the European Publishers Council, welcomed “Microsoft’s recognition” of the value “our content brings to the core business of search engines and social networks.” 
“It is crucial that our regulators recognise this key point, and don’t get misled into thinking that side deals on the basis of a standalone product are the same thing,” he said, adding, “All publishers should get an agreement — no one should be left out.”

Microsoft, Google, and Qualcomm are among major tech companies that have complained to US antitrust regulators regarding NVIDIA’s acquisition of Arm. Bloomberg reported that at least once complaining company wants the deal killed, though it did not specify which. The concern from the tech giants is that NVIDIA purchasing Arm will hurt competition.
Microsoft, Google, and Qualcomm are asking antitrust officials to intervene with the deal, according to sources that spoke with Bloomberg that have asked to not be identified as they aren’t authorized to publicly speak on the subject.
NVIDIA officially started to acquire Arm limited in September 2020, though rumors of a potential deal started in July 2020. The deal price was valued at US$40 billion and was announced by NVIDIA.
Arm licenses out its chip designs and software to several major tech companies, including Apple, Intel, Samsung Electronics, Amazon, and many others. Most people have used one of their chips on a phone, tablet, or PC at some point. Bloomberg calls Arm the “Switzerland of the industry” and highlights the concern that NVIDIA owning Arm could limit access to chips for rival companies.
According to Bloomberg, NVIDIA claims that there isn’t any incentive to change the neutrality of Arm. The company cites the purchase price of Arm as a reason to not change what’s working, but Bloomberg states that rival companies and many people don’t believe that to be the case.

450,"June 15, 2022",Why Tech Regulators Need to Think Like Google,"
As many of the world’s largest companies are platform-based technology companies, there has been a growing push worldwide to regulate these companies to address issues arising from economic, political and communications power. At the same time, their distinctive platform business models raise new challenges to regulators, such as what industries they are in, what problems connect to which regulatory authority, and who has jurisdictional authority and regulatory capacity. The paper argues that regulators increasingly need to “think like Google”: they need to be able to adopt holistic strategies that can apply across industry silos and different regulatory responsibilities. There is also a need to empower the notion of regulation in the public interest, to challenge the ideational power of tech companies that they are superior stewards of public good to government agencies.

By Terry Flew[1]
 
I. The Challenge of Platform Business Models
The 2020s have been a period where the policy spotlight has been thrown upon the power of Big Tech. The reasons are not surprising. Platform-based technology companies experienced phenomenal growth during the 2010s and early 2020s, to become the world’s largest companies and most valuable brands.
According to Kantar BrandZ, the seven most valuable brands in 2021 were platform-based technology companies (in order): Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Tencent, Facebook, and Alibaba.[2] They sit alongside a slew of other tech-base...

452,"June 6, 2022","Google Is Liable for Content Posted Online, Australian Court Says","


An Australian court found search engine giant Google liable for defamatory videos posted on its YouTube platform that targeted a senior politician, a reminder that social media companies could be held responsible in some jurisdictions for what users put online. 
The ruling revives the question of how much culpability technology firms have for defamation conveyed by users on their websites in Australia, one of few Western nations where online platforms have the same legal responsibility as publishers.
Australia is reviewing what legal exposure platforms should have for defamatory posts. A landmark case in 2021, where a newspaper was found liable for defamatory reader comments below an article posted on Facebook, drove global firms to reduce their social media presence in the country.
The judgment showed Google had denied the videos carried defamatory imputations, and said the YouTuber had the right to an honestly held opinion and should be protected by the right to criticise a politician.”They (Google) were advised that those defamatory videos were there, they looked into it, they decided for themselves that they weren’t, and left them up,” said Prof David Rolph, a specialist in media law at the University of Sydney Law School.
The conflict over defamation and liability adds to the already fraught relationship between Google and Australia’s media and regulators. The country has been at the forefront of confronting the dominance of Big Tech in journalism, with a landmark ruling last year forcing Google and Facebook to pay news organizations for using their content, one of the main drivers of traffic to these platforms.

Russia’s communications regulator Roskomnadzor said on Friday it had opened administrative cases against Google and six other foreign technology companies for alleged violations of personal data legislation.
Moscow has clashed with Big Tech over content, censorship, data and local representation in a simmering dispute that has erupted into a full-on information battle since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Russia fined Google 3 million roubles ($46,540) last year for not storing the personal data of Russian users in databases on Russian territory, and on Friday said it had opened a new case over what it called Google’s repeated failure to comply with Russian legislation.
Google, which declined to comment, could be fined between 6-18 million roubles, Roskomnadzor said.
The regulator also said it had opened cases against six other companies – Airbnb, Pinterest, Likeme, Twitch, Apple and United Parcel Service – for alleged first-time offences carrying a potential fine of 1-6 million roubles.

455,"May 26, 2022",UK Hits Google With Second Antitrust Probe Into Ad Dominance,"


The UK’s competition regulator has opened a fresh investigation into Google, taking aim at the company’s role in the advertising technology market.
It’s the second major antitrust probe to target Google’s ad practices in the UK The Competition and Markets Authority launched a separate investigation with the European Union into Google and Facebook parent company Meta earlier this year over concerns that a 2018 pact between the two companies known as “Jedi Blue”  restricted competition in digital advertising.
The CMA said Thursday it was assessing whether Google’s role in the ad tech industry may be distorting competition. The internet giant is a dominant player in the online ad market.
Google acts as both a demand-side platform, which offers publishers’ ad inventory to marketers, and an ad exchange, which lets advertisers compete for advertising space on publishers’ websites, the CMA said. It also runs ad servers which manage publishers’ inventory.
Regulators are concerned Google may have illegally favored its own ad exchange services to the detriment of rivals. The CMA is also worried Google limited the compatibility of its ad exchange with third-party ad servers to make it harder for competing ad servers to compete.
“Weakening competition in this area could reduce the ad revenues of publishers, who may be forced to compromise the quality of their content to cut costs or put their content behind paywalls,” Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s chief executive, said in a statement.
“It may also be raising costs for advertisers which are passed on through higher prices for advertised goods and services.”
It comes after an earlier competition probe from both the UK and EU into “Jedi Blue.” The deal allegedly involved Google and Meta rigging auctions for online ads and illegally fixing prices.

Google’s Waze and Samsung convinced a US appeals court Monday to move separate patent lawsuits against them over map technology from East Texas federal court to Northern California.
Chief US District Judge Rodney Gilstrap should have granted the companies’ request to transfer AGIS Software Development’s lawsuits because the California court was a more convenient place to try them, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said.
AGIS’ attorney Fred Fabricant of Fabricant said he and the company were “very disappointed.” He said it “strains all logic” to transfer the cases, which were set for trials in June and August, based on convenience.
Google spokesperson José Castañeda said the company was pleased with the decision. He added that Google has called for the end of forum shopping by parties looking to sue in jurisdictions seen as friendly to their patent claims, “which only furthers abusive and costly litigation.”
AGIS sued the three companies in Marshall, Texas in 2019, arguing user-communication technology in Google and Waze’s map apps violated its patents. Samsung’s devices that work with Google’s apps also infringe, AGIS said.
Gilstrap rejected the defendants’ request to move the cases to Google’s home district in Northern California. The judge said court congestion and judicial economy favored keeping the cases in Texas, and noted that he had already presided over a case involving the same patents.

Legislation introduced in the US Senate would force Google to break up its online advertising business marking one of the most aggressive attempts to rein in big technology companies by lawmakers, reported CNBC. 
The Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act is targeting conflicts of interest in ad technology, and would block companies that process more than $20 billion a year in digital ad transactions from taking part in more than one part of the digital ad ecosystem.
The bill would ban companies that process more than $20 billion annually in digital ad transactions from participating in more than one part of the digital ad process, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Google infamously has a hand in multiple steps of the digital ad process, a business that has become the focus of a state-led antitrust lawsuit against the company. Google runs an auction, or exchange, where ad transactions are made and also runs tools to help companies sell and buy ads. If the new legislation passed, it would have to choose in which part of the business it would want to remain.
“When you have Google simultaneously serving as a seller and a buyer and running an exchange, that gives them an unfair, undue advantage in the marketplace, one that doesn’t necessarily reflect the value they are providing,” Lee told the Journal in an interview. “When a company can wear all these hats simultaneously, it can engage in conduct that harms everyone.”

It has claimed that the proposed deal once through would have a destabilizing effect on the e-commerce market of India.
“The petition provides evidence to show Cloudtail charges less fees/commission and is a preferential seller on the platform, and with a 100 per cent acquisition of Cloudtail, a preferred seller and the marketplace at its e-commerce portal, Amazon will cause an adverse effect on the market,” CAIT stated.

Reuters has reported Amazon has filed a new legal challenge in its continued dispute with Indian retailer Future Group. The national antitrust agency recently suspended a 2019 deal between the two companies, halting their arbitration.
Last month, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) suspended Amazon’s 2019 deal with Future, preventing Amazon from selling Future’s retail assets to Reliance Industries. On Saturday, January 8, Amazon filed an appeal against the CCI suspension decision at India’s National Company Law Appellate Tribunal.

Amazon has also filed a challenge in the Supreme Court against the Delhi court decision where judges said Future-Amazon arbitration proceedings are on pause until February 1 because of the antitrust suspension deal. Reliance wants to attempt to buy Future, a debt-straddled company, to further help its position in India’s retail market.
Amazon has fought this telling India’s antitrust authorities that this would restrict competition in India’s retail market. They have also argued the sale would violate the terms of its 2019 deal with Future. The CCI suspended that deal saying Amazon suppressed information while looking for clearances for the deal, therefore leaving Amazon with no legal legs to stand on. The case will likely be heard before court this week.

463,"January 7, 2022",DOJ Amazon Marketplace Sellers Plead Guilty To Price Fixing,"


A New Jersey man and two New York men pleaded guilty yesterday to fixing the prices of DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs sold on the Amazon Marketplace, reported the DOJ. 
According to court documents filed in Knoxville, Tennessee, Morris Sutton, Emmanuel Hourizadeh and Raymond Nouvahian were charged with conspiring with others to fix prices of DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs sold through the Amazon Marketplace. The price-fixing conspiracy each engaged in was ongoing from at least as early as November 2017 and continued until at least Oct. 29, 2019. Sutton, Hourizadeh and Nouvahian are the second, third and fourth individuals to be charged and to plead guilty in the ongoing investigation. 
“As American consumers increasingly turn to e-commerce, it is critically important to deter, detect and prosecute crimes that prevent fair and open competition in online marketplaces,” said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “These charges demonstrate the Antitrust Division’s continued commitment to prosecuting anticompetitive conduct wherever it may occur.”
According to a one-count information charging Sutton, and another one-count information charging Hourizadeh and Nouvahian, each of the charged individuals and his co-conspirators agreed to raise and maintain the prices of DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs sold in their Amazon Marketplace storefronts. The Amazon Marketplace is an e-commerce platform that enables third-party vendors to sell new or used products alongside Amazon’s own offerings. The Amazon Marketplace is owned and operated by Amazon.
“Price-fixing schemes chip away at the benefits afforded to us by a fair market system,” said Assistant Director in Charge Michael J. Driscoll of the FBI’s New York Field Office. “Artificially inflating prices to avoid giving consumers a choice, for the sole purpose of benefiting those involved in the fraudulent scheme, is a violation of federal law. These guilty pleas should serve as a warning to other like-minded criminals.”
“We are gratified to have contributed to this investigation and applaud the exceptional work by the investigative team for both protecting the individual consumer and the deterrence of activities in violation of the Sherman Act,” said Special Agent in Charge Ken Cleevely of the US Postal Service, Office of Inspector General (USPS OIG). “Along with our law enforcement partners, the USPS OIG will continue to aggressively investigate those who would engage in this type of harmful conduct.”
A criminal violation of the Sherman Act carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $1 million criminal fine for individuals. The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the US Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

464,"January 4, 2022",India’s High Court Dismissed Arbitration In Amazon Case,"


The Delhi High Court on Tuesday, January 4, dismissed pleas by Future Group companies to direct the arbitration tribunal adjudicating on Amazon’s objections against their deal with Reliance, to decide on their termination applications first before continuing with the arbitration proceedings.
Justice Amit Bansal noted the grievance of the Future Group was that in terms of the December 2021 orders of the arbitral tribunal, no date had been fixed for a hearing on their termination applications.
“The said grievance… stands redressed by the subsequent email dated January 1, 2022 of the Arbitral Tribunal in terms of which the date of January 8, 2022 has been fixed for hearing on the termination applications,” he said.
Future Coupons and Future Retail had also contended the Tribunal was continuing with hearings in respect of expert witnesses, while deferring those on the termination application.
Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing FCPL, argued that the hearing of the termination applications should have taken priority over the hearings of the expert witnesses as the said applications go to the very root of the matter and the arbitration proceedings would not survive if the applications filed on behalf of his client were allowed.

India’s Future Retail has asked a New Delhi court to declare arbitration proceedings in Singapore with Amazon.com as illegal, arguing that India’s antitrust agency had suspended a 2019 deal used by Amazon to assert rights over Future.
Amazon successfully used the terms of its toehold US$200 million investment in debt-laden Future to block the Indian retailer’s attempt to sell retail assets to a rival, alleging breach of certain contracts, reported Reuters.
But the Indian antitrust body, the Competition Commission of India, in December suspended the 2019 deal stating Amazon suppressed information while seeking approvals.
The long-running dispute is being heard by a Singapore arbitration panel, but both sides have been fighting parallel cases in Indian courts to enforce or overrule certain decisions taken by the arbitrator.

466,"January 3, 2022",Yet Another Amazon Antitrust Paradox,"
By: Ramsi Woodcock (What Am I Missing?)
Amazon paradoxes are proliferating. Here’s another: to the extent that Amazon is engaged in anticompetitive conduct, it is the conduct of opening its website to third-party sellers, not, as Amazon critics hold, the conduct of failing to be even more welcoming to those third-party sellers.
As the Times’ David Streitfeld, who has perhaps done more than anyone else to advance the notion that Amazon is unreasonably severe with third-party sellers, seems slowly to be realizing, Amazon’s third-party sellers are, well, a problem. They sell junk. They sell defective products. They fool their customers. And then they disappear.
As the Wall Street Journal alerted us more than two years ago now: Amazon’s open door policy with respect to third-party sellers, which sellers constitute more than 50% of sales on Amazon.com, has caused Amazon effectively to “cede control of its site,” badly degrading the shopping experience.
Which begs the question: why? Why would Amazon let this happen? The answers is: “dreams of monopoly.”
Every other retailer in the world seems to understand that one of the biggest pieces of value retail can deliver to consumers is: curation. The retailer does the hard work of sifting through the junk and the fakes and the defectives to find the good stuff, so that consumers don’t have to do that themselves. Why do you shop at Trader Joe’s instead of your local supermarket? Because you know that if Trader Joe’s is selling it, it’s probably not only of reasonable quality, but likely tastes great too. That’s the value of curation.
But, as Streitfeld correctly notes, Amazon has all but given up on it. Anyone can list products on Amazon. And the company makes almost no effort to flag the best products for you. Ever since that Journal article, the public has known that “Amazon’s Choice” is just an empty label slapped on a piece of third-party seller junk by an algorithm parsing sales trends. No one at Amazon can vouch for the underlying product’s quality, usefulness, or safety…

The National Football League (NFL) its teams and licensing partner, Fanatics, Inc. were hit with federal antitrust claims in San Francisco, CAby a merchandising business and a consumer claiming they conspired to “strangle the competition” and monopolize NFL product sales through Amazon’s third-party marketplace.
According to Bloomberg Law,  the NFL began threatening to withhold fan gear licensing from distributors who supplied the merchandise to Amazon retailers other than Fanatics after investing about $95 million in Fanatics in 2017.
The lawsuit read, “Fanatics recognized the problem that robust competition on Amazon posed to it … Distributors were forced to abandon business relationships with smaller retailers, but Fanatics allegedly told them it would mitigate the loss by snapping up more of the distributor’s product itself.”
The lawsuits were filed by Casey’s Distributing, an online retailer of fan-licensed products and Ohio consumer Natalie Wheeler Hastings. Omaha-based Casey’s distributes NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, NCAA, and MLS-branded products and memorabilia to retailers.

468,"December 22, 2021",Amazon Looks To Buy Large Indian E-commerce Firm,"
Online marketplace Amazon India has proposed to take full control of Cloudtail, the largest and longest-serving seller on its platform, just months after deciding to end the joint venture, reported Mint. 
On Wednesday, Amazon said it approached the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for approval to acquire Narayana Murthy-led Catamaran Ventures stake in Prione, which operates Cloudtail. If CCI approves the deal, Amazon will fully own Prione.
“Prione Business Services Pvt. Ltd, the joint venture between Catamaran and Amazon, will be acquired by Amazon subject to requisite regulatory approvals. On 9 August, the partners had announced their decision to not continue the JV beyond the end of its current term of May 2022. Amazon will buy Catamaran’s shareholding in Prione in compliance with applicable laws, including all assets and liabilities,” Amazon India and Catamaran said in a joint statement.
Once Amazon takes full ownership, though, Cloudtail won’t be able to continue as a seller on the marketplace under India’s current rules.
India prohibits foreign direct investment (FDI) in inventory-based models for e-commerce and permits firms such as Amazon India and Flipkart to work only as marketplaces for other businesses. Under Press Note 2 issued by the commerce ministry’s department of industrial policy and promotion on 26 December 2018, marketplaces cannot participate in seller activities through any group firms. To abide by the law, in 2019, Catamaran Ventures raised its stake in Cloudtail’s parent to 76% from 51% earlier, with Amazon reducing its stake to 24% from 49% earlier.

469,"December 22, 2021",The FTC Draws Its Attention To Amazon’s Cloud Service,"
The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is advancing an antitrust probe into Amazon’s cloud computing business, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday.
FTC officials have contacted companies in the past few months to gather information about competition issues related to Amazon Web Services (AWS), according to the report. 
The focus on Amazon’s $16 billion cloud business, which brings in most of the e-commerce giant’s profit, comes as Khan has set her sights on conduct by the biggest U.S. tech companies. Khan, a former Columbia Law School professor, rose to prominence in antitrust circles warning about the threats companies like Amazon pose to competition in the digital economy.
One issue the FTC could look at is whether Amazon has an incentive to discriminate against software companies that sell their products to clients of AWS, while at the same time competing with Amazon. The fear is that Amazon could punish the companies that work with other cloud providers and favor those that it works with exclusively.
The FTC’s investigation of Amazon began during the Trump administration under former chairman Joe Simons. The agency has pursued inquiries about Amazon’s retail business as well as the cloud division, Bloomberg has reported. The renewed outreach to companies shows the probe is active.
Amazon has provided information to the FTC in response to the agency’s requests, according to a person familiar with the matter.

470,"September 12, 2021","Rulings In Facebook, Apple Antitrust Cases Show How Tough It Is To Define A Monopoly In The Age Of Big Tech","


By Cat Zakrzewski,  Washington Post
For the second time in three months, a judge has determined that a major antitrust challenge against a tech giant failed to prove the company was maintaining an illegal monopoly.
From opposite sides of the country, two Obama-appointed judges, in separate decisions in separate cases, have undercut the mounting effort to rein in the power of Big Tech.
Northern California Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Friday ruled against the foundational argument of Epic Games’ high-profile antitrust lawsuit against Apple, determining that Epic had “overreached” in claiming that Apple had exercised monopoly control in its App Store.
Her ruling comes on the heels of D.C. Judge James E. Boasberg’s June decision to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit against Facebook, finding that the agency had failed to provide enough evidence to prove that Facebook had a monopoly in social networking.

Facebook has rejected the concerns of the UK competition regulator over its acquisition of Giphy, a provider of popular animated images, and said it shouldn’t have to sell the company, reported Reuters.
Facebook bought Giphy in 2020 with the intention of integrating it with Instagram. In August this year, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority stated it had provisionally found that the deal would harm competition between social-media platforms and in the display advertising market and that it could force Facebook to sell Giphy.
Related: UK Regulator Says Facebook’s Giphy Deal Raises Competition Concerns
In a letter published Wednesday, September 8, by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Facebook argued that the regulator had failed to show a substantial effect on competition and that no remedies were necessary.
Facebook also stated there were “serious questions” as to whether the CMA could enforce an order for it to sell Giphy.
“These are questions which the CMA must carefully consider, and address, before taking the extreme intrusive step of ordering the sale of a company which does not carry on business in the UK,” Facebook stated.
The CMA last month hinted that Facebook, the world’s largest social media company, might need to sell Giphy based on its preliminary findings that the deal would hurt the display advertising market and other social media networks.
While far from the largest deal Facebook has ever done, the Giphy acquisition, could be the company’s first high-profile deal to be unwound by government officials since Facebook began confronting questions about its powerful position in digital markets several years ago. And it shows how closely officials are watching Facebook’s every move.
In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said the company disagrees with the finding and that it lacks evidence. “This merger is in the best interest of people and businesses in the UK — and around the world — who use Giphy and our services,” the spokesperson said. “We will continue to work with the CMA to address the misconception that the deal harms competition.”

472,"September 1, 2021",Elizabeth Warren Asks DOJ To Probe Google-Facebook Ad Deal,"


Four members of Congress have asked the Justice Department to launch a criminal investigation into whether an advertising agreement between Facebook and Alphabet violated federal antitrust laws.
The letter, signed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Democrat – Massachusetts) and Richard Blumenthal (Democrat – Connecticut), and Reps. Pramila Jayapal (Democrat – Washington), and Mondaire Jones (Democrat – New York), was sent to Attorney General Merrick Garland and Acting US Attorney Nicholas Ganjei.
Federal criminal cases can take years, but a probe would form a new front in the multi-pronged effort to rein in Big Tech. Prior efforts against the tech giants have largely been in the form of civil litigation, directives to federal agencies, and proposed legislation. The Federal Trade Commission has filed a civil suit against Facebook for alleged antitrust activities.
The letter takes issue with an agreement between Google and Facebook executives. Information about the pact, nicknamed “Jedi Blue,” and Google’s alleged efforts to secure dominance in online advertising were first outlined in the Texas-led complaint last year and subsequent court documents, some of which were improperly redacted. The suit alleges that Google executives “induced” senior Facebook staff to agree to a plan to undermine competition in digital advertising. Many of the accusations in the Texas-led suit relate to Google’s ad technology, which companies use to buy and sell ads on the web.
The letter notes that in exchange for backing off technology that threatened Google’s dominance, Facebook received a fixed percentage of ad bids on Google’s platform.

EU antitrust regulators will decide on January 7 whether to clear Facebook’s purchase of US customer service startup Kustomer, a European Commission filing showed on Wednesday, August 25, extending the deadline for a second time after Facebook asked for more time.
The EU executive, which acts as the competition enforcer for the 27-country bloc, is investigating the deal on concerns that it may hurt competition and reinforce the US social media company’s power in online advertising, reported Reuters.
That could ratchet up the pressure on Facebook to offer concessions to address EU competition worries.
The UK competition watchdog is also investigating the acquisition while its German counterpart is checking to see if Facebook should also seek its approval.
Facebook, the world’s largest social network, announced the purchase of Kustomer to scale up its instant messaging app WhatsApp in November last year.
The EU executive, which acts as the bloc’s competition enforcer, said the deal may result in Facebook blocking rivals’ access to its units WhatsApp, Messenger, or Instagram, which are key to customer relationship management (CRM) software.
Kustomer sells CRM software to businesses so they can communicate with consumers by phone, email, text messages, WhatsApp, Instagram, and other channels.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a new antitrust complaint against Facebook on Thursday, August 19, continuing its fight in federal court after a judge threw out its initial claims.
Facebook has until October 4 to respond to the FTC’s amended complaint. The agency had to refile the case after the judge overseeing it said in June that the government had not provided enough evidence that Facebook was a monopoly in social networking, reported The New York Times.
The judge’s decision, and a similar one he made in a case against the company brought by more than 40 states, dealt a stunning blow to regulators’ attempts to rein in Big Tech.
Related: Judge Dismisses FTC’s Antitrust Lawsuit Against Facebook
His decision presented the first major test for Lina Khan, the FTC chair, who was only days into her role at the time. Ms. Khan represents a wave of new thinking about the industry among administration officials and many lawmakers, arguing that the government needs to take far more aggressive action to stem the power of technology giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. President Biden has appointed multiple regulators with similar aims and lawmakers proposed updates to antitrust laws to target the power of technology companies.
The new complaint is longer than the original, clocking in at 80 pages compared to 53. But in broad strokes, it maintains the core arguments of the original, including allegations that Facebook used anticompetitive acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp to further its monopoly power and that it also unfairly blocked rivals from accessing its application programming interface (API).
The judge also dismissed a similar lawsuit from a coalition of state attorneys general in June, but declined to give them the same second chance as the FTC. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the coalition, said they would seek to appeal the ruling.

476,"August 18, 2021",Facebook Continues To Push For FTC Chair Recusal,"


Facebook has continued to push for Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairwoman Lina Khan to recuse herself from antitrust matters involving the social media giant.
On Tuesday, August 17, Facebook submitted to the FTC an expert report from Northwestern law professor Daniel Rodriguez in favor of Khan recusing herself. The expert report was first noted by Politico.
Facebook joined fellow big tech giant Amazon in urging for Khan’s recusal earlier this summer. Both argued that Khan’s criticisms of big tech in the past make her unable to be impartial in any antitrust cases. 
Khan, who has massive support from progressives and consumer interest groups, has been an outspoken critic of big tech companies. She published a 2017 paper called “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” She was named the chair of the FTC following her confirmation hearing earlier this year. 
The report from Rodriguez comes ahead of the FTC needing to decide whether it will amend its complaint against Facebook. A judge dismissed the complaint in late June, but left the door open for the agency to amend it and resubmit it. 
Rodriguez essentially echoes Facebook’s assertion that Khan’s past criticisms would bar her from being impartial in a case. 
“In my opinion, a reasonable observer could not conclude that Chair Khan is likely to bring an open mind and impartial attitude to Facebook’s case in light of her previous public statements, scholarship, and congressional work,” the report read.

477,"August 17, 2021",FTC’s Deadline To Amended Facebook Complaint Is This Week,"


The US FTC may have a second chance to prove to a federal judge that Facebook has illegally maintained a monopoly, reported CNBC.
By Thursday, the agency must file an amended complaint if it wishes to continue pursuing its claims against Facebook in federal court.
Related: Judge OKs Extension For FTC To Refile Facebook Suit
That’s because a judge threw out the FTC’s initial complaint, saying it didn’t do enough to show that Facebook illegally maintains monopoly power to warrant moving the case forward. But, he left the FTC an opportunity to make a stronger case in a new filing.
The FTC has a couple options on how to proceed besides choosing to file an amended complaint. It could decide to drop the matter altogether. Or it could bring the case before its internal administrative law judge instead.
The former seems unlikely given the scale of this case for the agency and its newly-confirmed Chair Lina Khan, who has been critical of digital platforms and has pushed for greater enforcement of antitrust laws.
The latter is made more complicated by the fact that Facebook has called for Khan’s recusal from its case based on her past criticism. Khan hasn’t responded to the request, but assuming she wants to participate in the case, that would likely be easier to do if her participation involves voting on whether to file a complaint in federal court, rather than act as an adjudicator under the FTC’s internal process.
Here’s what the FTC needs to address in its amended complaint if it hopes to continue its fight with Facebook in federal court.

480,"February 3, 2022",Apple App Store Antitrust Bill OK’ed By Senate Judiciary Committee,"


The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, February 3, approved legislation that, if passed into law, would force Apple to let users install apps from outside of the App Store, reported Axios.
If the bill passes the full Senate and makes it to President Joe Biden’s desk, Google and Apple would essentially have to give up full control of their app stores.
According to Axios, the new rules could require them both to allow app side-loading, installing apps from non-sanctioned marketplaces, and alternative payment processing systems. Apple and Google have argued vehemently against the bill.
The 21-1 vote shows there’s increasing support in Congress for the kinds of bills that aim to reel in Big Tech companies. It will still be a long haul for this bill to become law, but it’s notable that it made it out of committee so easily, garnering the support of many Republicans.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Democrat – Minnesota), a co-author of the bill along with Sens. Richard Blumenthal (Democrat – Connecticut) and Marsha Blackburn (Republican – Tennessee), dismissed tech company claims that the bill would cause privacy and security problems.
The Open App Markets Act, spearheaded by Sens. Blumenthal and Blackburn, the chair and ranking member of subcommittee on consumer protection, seeks to require dominant app stores to make it easier for developers to distribute their apps and connect with their customers.
The app store operators have opposed the bill as originally drafted, warning it could jeopardize consumer privacy and result in a worse user experience.
″This bill could destroy many consumer benefits that current payment systems provide and distort competition by exempting gaming platforms, which amounts to Congress trying to artificially pick winners and losers in a highly competitive marketplace,” Google VP of Government Affairs and Public Policy Mark Isakowitz said in a statement ahead of the markup. App Store
In a letter to Judiciary Committee leaders obtained by CNBC, Apple Senior Director of Government Affairs in the Americas Timothy Powderly wrote, “We are deeply concerned that the legislation, unless amended, would make it easier for big social media platforms to avoid the pro-consumer practices of Apple’s App Store, and allow them to continue business as usual. It does so by mandating that Apple allow the sideloading of apps and app stores that need not comply with the App Store’s pro-consumer privacy protections.”

The industry group for app developers is pushing Congress to pass the Open App Markets Act, a bipartisan Senate bill that would block app stores from favoring their own in-house apps in searches, requiring developers to use their payment systems and preventing users from downloading apps from third-party stores.  
Developers surveyed by the group complained about exorbitant fees charged by the largest app stores — Apple charges a 30% commission on app store sales for large developers — and expressed how they’d experienced difficulty getting their apps featured or accepted by app stores.

Apple is stifling competition with its monopoly on app distribution through the App Store, attorneys general for 35 states told a California appeals court on Thursday, January 27.
The joint statement was submitted into the appeals process that is ongoing following the judge’s decision in the Epic v. Apple lawsuit, with the attorneys general siding with the “Fortnite” video game maker on the issue, reported Reuters.
“Apple’s conduct has harmed and is harming mobile app-developers and millions of citizens,” the states stated.
“Meanwhile, Apple continues to monopolize app distribution and in-app payment solutions for iPhones, stifle competition, and amass supracompetitive profits within the almost trillion-dollar-a-year smartphone industry.”
The action comes after a US district judge in Oakland, California, mostly ruled against Epic last year.
That decision found that commissions of 15% to 30% which Apple charges some app makers for use of an in-app payment system the company forced on them did not violate antitrust law.
Epic challenged the ruling in the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals. On Thursday, professors, activist groups, and the states weighed in through court filings that described legal arguments in support.

The fines now amounted to €114.7 million (US$130.04 million) for Apple and €58.6 million for Amazon, down from €134.5 million and €68.7 million, respectively, the watchdog said in a statement.
The authority had stated in November it had fined the two groups for allegedly engaging in anti-competitive cooperation in the sale of Apple and Beats products.

486,"January 19, 2022",Apple & Google Tell US Lawmaker Antitrust Bill Would Harm Privacy,"


Apple and Google argued to lawmakers Tuesday, January 18, that bipartisan antitrust legislation aimed at curbing the power of big technology companies would harm the privacy and security of users if it becomes law, reported the LA Times.
Escalating its opposition to the legislation, Apple sent a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Richard J. Durbin; the panel’s ranking Republican, Charles E. Grassley; Antitrust Subcommittee Chair Amy Klobuchar; and the subcommittee’s ranking Republican, Mike Lee. The letter, which was obtained by Bloomberg News, underscores Apple’s push to protect its App Store from government oversight and changes that would disrupt its business model.
“After a tumultuous year that witnessed multiple controversies regarding social media, whistle-blower allegations of long-ignored risks to children, and ransomware attacks that hobbled critical infrastructure, it would be ironic if Congress responds by making it much harder to protect the privacy and security of Americans’ personal devices,” Tim Powderly, Apple’s senior director of government affairs, wrote in the letter. “Unfortunately, that is what these bills would do.”

487,"January 17, 2022",Dutch Dating Apps Update Payment Methods After Apple Ruling,"


The iPhone maker agreed this weekend to changes to its App Store in the Netherlands focused on dating apps, agreeing to allow local developers of dating apps to be able to offer non-Apple based payments, reported TechCrunch.
In December, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) found Apple in breach of national competition rules — ordering it to adjust what it described as “unreasonable conditions” in the App Store that apply to dating app providers.
Apple had been facing the threat of a financial penalty if it failed to make changes by the weekend.

The tech giant went to court to seek an injunction against the order last month, including seeking to prevent the regulator from publishing its decision and applying for a temporary suspension of the order.
However, in a December ruling, the court largely rejected Apple’s arguments — giving the company until January 15 to comply with the order to let dating app providers offer alternative payment options to their users.
“The case concerns the conditions Apple imposes on dating app providers if they want to sell digital content in their apps (such as ‘superlikes’ and ‘boosts’). Those conditions mean, among other things, that payments from consumers must be made to Apple as a so-called commission agent of the dating app providers using certain software (the IAP API) that Apple has built into its iOS operating system. The dating app providers may not use any other payment settlement method and may not refer to another payment method in their apps,” the Rotterdam Court wrote [translated from Dutch using machine translation] at the time.
“With regard to this part of the conditions, the preliminary relief judge follows the position of ACM that with these conditions Apple is abusing its dominant position in the market for app store services for dating app providers. Apple’s arguments that it would not have an economic dominant position and that the conditions are necessary are not successful.”

Apple stated on Saturday, January 15, it would allow developers of dating apps in the Netherlands to offer non-Apple payment options to their users, complying with an order from the country’s market regulator to do so by January 15 or face fines, reported Reuters.
The country’s Authority for Consumers and Markets found in a decision published on December 24 that Apple had abused its market position by requiring dating app developers, including Tinder owner Match Group, to exclusively use Apple’s in-app payment system. read more
Apple’s practice of requiring developers to use its system and pay commissions of 15-30% on digital goods purchases has come under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world, but the Dutch ruling applies only in the Netherlands and only for dating apps.
In a post on its developers’ blog on Saturday, Apple said it would comply with the decision and introduce “two optional new entitlements exclusively applicable to dating apps on the Netherlands App Store that provide additional payment processing options for users.”
However, it noted that developers were not required to use the non-Apple tools, and warned that Apple would not be able to help with safety or refunds of payments that take place outside its systems because it will “not be directly aware of them.”

489,"January 6, 2022","Apple App Store Monopoly Suit Tossed, For Now","


Apple on Wednesday convinced a federal judge in California to toss a lawsuit alleging the tech giant has a monopoly with its iOS app store, until the plaintiff, SaurikIT, can make specific allegations that fall clearly within the statute of limitations, reported Bloomberg. 
Alternative app store SaurikIT, also known as Cydia, filed suit in 2020, alleging violations of the Sherman Act and Unfair Competition Law. Cydia said Apple lifted parts of the Cydia store and incorporated them into its App Store in 2008, and then continued to make it impossible for users to change their default preference to another app.
In December, in the Northern District of California, SaurikIT filed a complaint against Apple  alleging the tech giant has monopolized the markets for iOS app distribution and iOS app payment processing through anticompetitive conduct that shut out the competition, including the plaintiff, who had created an app store of their own.  
The plaintiff claimed that “(h)historically, distribution of apps for a specific operating system (‘OS’) occurred in a separate and robustly competitive market.” However, SaurikIT averred that Apple “began coercing users” to solely utilize its App Store for iOS apps and their distribution. Allegedly, Apple engaged in this endeavor for the economic opportunity that it provided after seeing the “economic promise that iOS app distribution represented” for other entities with their own iOS app distribution product or service, such as the plaintiff. Subsequently, Apple moved into this market and also entered the iOS app payment processing market.
SaurikIT’s Cydia, which was developed in 2008, was a once-popular iOS app distribution marketplace platform, allowing iOS users a place to discover and obtain a wide range of third-party iOS apps, such as games, productivity apps, and audiovisual apps like a video recorder because the original iPhone’s camera could only capture still photographs, the complaint said.

490,"February 11, 2021",Microsoft Reportedly Considered $51B Pinterest Buy,"


Microsoft was in talks with US$51 billion Pinterest for a possible acquisition deal, but the discussions are currently on hold, Financial Times reported on Thursday, February 11, citing sources.
The discussions were part of Microsoft’s strategy to snap up social platforms with engaged communities that could operate parallel to its cloud, one of the sources told FT.
Pinterest is a social media community where people curate their own virtual corkboards with lifestyle ideas — recipes, hairstyles, décor, and more. It has experienced a pandemic-fueled surge in popularity, with 459 million members and a 600% increase in market value since the virus took hold in March. In contrast, Microsoft, valued at US$1.83 trillion, saw an 80% increase from a pandemic low.
The deal would have been Microsoft’s biggest acquisition to date — and President Joe Biden’s first big tech mega-merger to consider. Microsoft mostly falls under the antitrust radar because it largely does business with corporate and government entities.
Microsoft had previously looked into the acquisition of the Chinese social video platform TikTok, but Oracle stepped in and put the kibosh on the deal. Over the years, Microsoft has scooped up several prominent companies, including LinkedIn for $26 billion in 2016, GitHub and Minecraft, FT reported.
Pinterest went public in 2019 at US$19 a share and raised US$1.43 billion at a US$10 billion valuation. It started trading on the New York Stock Exchange April 18, 2019. It had 82 million regular users, about 80% of which are a powerful demographic — American mothers.
Pinterest is also taking advantage of the social commerce trend, integrating augmented reality features like virtual try-on tools and teaming up with Shopify to expand the availability of merchandise.

491,"February 7, 2021",Microsoft CEO Says Big Tech Antitrust Issues Can Be Solved With Laws,"


Microsoft President Brad Smith said that though Microsoft isn’t a target for these new big tech antitrust cases, there are key lessons governments should take from its 2001 case, reported CNET.
“Twenty years ago, almost solely the vehicle that governments used was an investigation and a lawsuit. It was a case against individual companies,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said Tuesday, February 2, during an editorial roundtable with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. This time around, Smith said, governments appear to realize that legislation can help solve larger concerns about competition. “I think regulators have broadly concluded that cases are both too narrow and too slow.”
The European Union has introduced ideas like the Digital Markets Act, which seeks to spell out how much companies with large user bases can promote their own products to users ahead of those from a competitor, and the Digital Services Act, which would put pressure on companies to do a better job moderating their platforms. Tech companies could face fines of up to 10% of their global revenue — easily reaching into the billions of dollars — for breaking these rules if they’re implemented.
The EU isn’t the only government targeting tech. Microsoft’s comments come at a time when governments around the world are expressing concerns about increasing signs of bad behavior among tech companies. Amazon, Apple and Google have been accused of kneecapping competitors by pushing their own products to the top of search results, deservedly or not. 
To Nadella, this is part of a larger problem with the tech world, where companies worry about growing first before they worry about unintended consequences that come with that type of scale. For example, he said, companies need to consider how their growth can impact people’s trust. And whether the company’s being fair as it grows.
“The business model and the technology need to account for the unintended consequence, with the unit of scale being one,” he said to CNET.
For many tech watchers, that’s a bit rich coming from the CEO of Microsoft, a company whose software reached a worldwide scale so quickly and forcefully that it eventually led to the antitrust ruling in 2001.

492,"February 3, 2021",Microsoft Says It Would Never “Threaten To Leave” Australia Like Google,"


Microsoft stated on Wednesday, February 3, it would never threaten to leave Australia after Google suggested it could pull its widely used search engine from the country, reported CNBC.
Google made the threat last month after the Australian government proposed a new law that would force the tech giant to pay news publishers for the right to link to their content.
“One thing is clear: while other tech companies may sometimes threaten to leave Australia, Microsoft will never make such a threat,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, in a statement.
“We are committed to supporting the country’s national security and economic success.”
Microsoft is well placed to capitalize from any fallout between Google and Australia. Google currently dominates search in the country, boasting a 94.5% market share, according to web analytics firm StatCounter, while Microsoft’s Bing holds just 3.6%.  
Smith said that he and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella spoke with Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week, who recently told reporters that Australia “did not respond to threats.”

Microsoft reached out to Australia’s competition regulator to open up Apple’s iPhones and iPads to competition and ensure Apple can no longer block competing apps, reported The Australian Financial Times.
In a submission to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Microsoft strongly criticized the walled-garden approach Apple takes to its phones and tablets, and suggested the regulator get Apple to open up its devices so they operate more like Windows 10.
The software giant, which itself battled regulators and legislators over its monopolistic practices 20 years ago, recently vowed to always allow competitors to distribute Windows 10 apps whichever way they pleased, and that it would always treat developers fairly if they chose to distribute their apps on the Microsoft Store.
Apple prevents app developers from distributing iPhone and iPad apps through any means other than the Apple App Store, which charges a 30% commission on many purchases, and it places onerous conditions on the App Store that many developers complain stifles competition.

Attorneys who prosecuted Microsoft for purported antitrust contraventions in the ’90s noticed some familiar procedures in the Department of Justice’s case against Google. However, multiple attorneys told CNBC that it is much different than an exact copy of the former case.
Stephen Houck, who served as the top attorney for the states in the Microsoft case, said, “What they’re trying to do is fit the facts of Google Into the theory of Microsoft.” However, he said that he believes the relevant facts are “very different.”
“I think they’re going to have a very difficult time proving this,” Houck said. He informed the outlet that he has consulted for Google during the last few years, but his questioning of the case’s strength arises from his own view.
Google’s leading attorney referred to the complaint as “deeply flawed” in a web post noting the firm’s first objections.

The target of the US government’s last major tech antitrust campaign could be the biggest beneficiary of its newest lawsuit, reported Wall Street Journal.
Microsoft’s Bing search engine is the only major competitor to Google’s dominant product, though it has less than 7% of the market. The Justice Department accused the Google of using anticompetitive tactics to preserve a monopoly for its flagship search engine and related advertising business in an antitrust lawsuit it filed Tuesday, October 20.The suit represents the biggest enforcement action against a major tech company since Microsoft and the US government went to battle more than two decades ago. The Justice Department’s latest charges echo those it leveled against the software maker in 1998.After years of litigation, Microsoft avoided a threatened breakup. But the distraction from the case helped rivals capitalize, such as Google becoming the dominant search provider.This time Microsoft could get the boost. “Anything that limits Google’s ability to move freely in the market is a good thing for Microsoft,” said Brad Reback, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.

Microsoft co-founder and former CEO Bill Gates told CNBC Wednesday morning, October 14, he had been naive about the government scrutiny that comes with getting large when he was running Microsoft.
“Whenever you get to be a super valuable company, affecting the way people communicate and even political discourse being mediated through your system and higher percentage of commerce through your system, you’re going to expect a lot of government attention,” Gates said in the “Squawk Box” interview.
Last week, the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust released a report concluding that Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google hold monopoly power.
“I was naive at Microsoft and didn’t realize that our success would lead to government attention,” Gates said, referring to Microsoft’s antitrust challenges from over 20 years ago. “And so I made some mistakes , you know, just saying, ‘Hey, I never go to Washington, DC’ And now I don’t think, you know, that naivete is there.”
Gates stepped down as Microsoft CEO in the middle of the US Justice Department’s antitrust case, which charged the company had tried to monopolize the web browser market when it bundled Internet Explorer with Windows. The company settled with the DOJ in 2001.

Microsoft announced a massive, $7.5 billion cash acquisition of Zenimax Media and its game publishing arm, Bethesda Softworks. The closure of the deal will also putt Bethesda Game Studios, id, Arkane, Zenimax Onlone, Tango Gameworks, Alpha Dog and Roundhouse Studios under the Microsoft and Xbox umbrellas, reported Bloomberg.

In a press release, Bethesda Game Studios vice president Pete Hines wrote that “Microsoft expects the acquisition to close in the second half of fiscal year 2021.” He also said that Bethesda’s games will be “made by the same studios we’ve worked with for years, and those games will be published by us.” That suggests some independence, and even the possibility of games being placed on other platforms.

Oracle will reportedly take over TikTok’s business in the US after China’s ByteDance rejected Microsoft’s offer.
The Wall Street Journal reported late Sunday that Oracle had been chosen as the winner in bidding for TikTok, and that an announcement would be made soon that Oracle will be TikTok’s “trusted tech partner” in the US. The deal would apparently fall short of an outright sale of the popular app.
That report came shortly after Microsoft said in a blog post that its bid for TikTok had been turned down. Neither Microsoft nor ByteDance offered an explanation for why the deal was rejected.
“ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok’s US operations to Microsoft,” Microsoft said. “We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users, while protecting national security interests. To do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement. We look forward to seeing how the service evolves in these important areas.” 
TikTok faces a Sept. 20 deadline to sell its US operations or face a ban by the Trump administration. The White House and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US still must approve the Oracle deal.

500,"May 16, 2022","Google, Meta Dodge UK’s Plan to Force Fairer Deals With Publishers","
The United Kingdom was about to join a list of countries including Australia, Canada, France and Spain that imposed limits on the negotiations between Big Tech firms and publishers to use news and content on tech platforms, but a change of heart in the U.K. government may delay this plan at least for a year. 
On Friday (May 6), the telecommunication regulator Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) published their joint advice to the U.K. government on how Big Tech companies should arrange “fairer deals” with online publishers in order to use their content. 
As in many other countries around the world, people have turned to online sources for their news, either through social media, search engines or apps provided by Google and Facebook, among other tech firms. Ofcom and CMA argue that “consumers and content providers, including newspapers, could benefit if the bargaining power of the biggest tech firms is properly managed.” 
The advice was set out in the form of a code of conduct that would mean that Big Tech firms with significant bargaining power would have to agree fair and reasonable terms for the content they use on their platforms. This code identifies a number of ways to do that, such as by addressing concerns about how algorithms work, and which factors are used to determine where different publisher’s content appears in searches, or by providing a framework for fair financial terms for the publisher’s content.
The code would also establish that in the event of a dispute between a platform and a publisher about the application of a code, the Digital Markets Unit (DMU) would have the role of deciding whether a contract or action by the firm was compliant. As proposed in other countries, the code would also give the DMU enforcement power to impose binding arbitration to ensure code breaches do not persist for long periods. 
Notably, the U.K. law would differ from other countries because the code would be a set of legally binding obligations for the biggest tech firms. Additionally, unlike Australia, the proposal in the U.K. has a broader focus: it was intended to shape the behavior of the Big Tech companies and reduce the imbalance of bargaining power across a range of digital markets. 
However, the biggest challenge was that the new code had to first be passed into law. The government would also have had to legally authorize the DMU to be fully operational and with statutory powers.
According to current news reports, U.K. ministers said neither the code nor the DMU will be part of the Queen’s Speech to be delivered Tuesday (May 10), when Queen Elizabeth will announce new laws for the next Parliamentary session. This means that while regulators can still work on a draft for the code and the DMU will continue assisting the CMA in existing investigations, the chances of publishing a legally binding code by the end of the year are slim. Accordingly, at present Google and Meta may not need to worry about legal restrictions when negotiating with publishers.

Google has signed deals to pay more than 300 publishers in Germany, France and four other EU countries for their news and will roll out a tool to make it easier for others to sign up too, the company told Reuters.
The move to be announced publicly later on Wednesday followed the adoption of landmark EU copyright rules three years ago that require Google and other online platforms to pay musicians, performers, authors, news publishers and journalists for using their work.
News publishers, among Google’s fiercest critics, have long urged governments to ensure online platforms pay fair remuneration for their content. Australia last year made such payments mandatory while Canada introduced similar legislation last month. 
“So far, we have agreements which cover more than 300 national, local and specialist news publications in Germany, Hungary, France, Austria, the Netherlands and Ireland, with many more discussions ongoing,” Sulina Connal, director for news and publishing partnerships, said in blogpost seen by Reuters and expected to be published later on Wednesday. The blog did not say how much publishers were being paid.
Two-thirds of this group are German publishers including Der Spiegel, Die Zeit and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
“We are now announcing the launch of a new tool to make offers to thousands more news publishers, starting in Germany and Hungary, and rolling out to other EU countries over the coming months,” Connal said in the blogpost.
The tool offers publishers an extended news preview agreement that allows Google to show snippets and thumbnails for a licensing fee.

Google won’t be offering paid apps or app updates for Russian users — but that’s not because the company wanted to exit the market, a report from Ars Technica said Monday (May 9).
A new support page pointed at by the tech-focused website says Google Play is “blocking the downloading of paid apps and updates to paid apps in Russia starting May 5, 2022.” Google has said that the blocking of paid apps is part of the tech giant’s “compliance efforts,” though after the big four credit card companies pulled out of Russia in March following their invasion of Ukraine, Google could no longer offer paid apps.
The page says users won’t be able to buy apps and games, make subscription payments or buy anything in-app using Google Play. There will still be free apps available, and paid apps users already bought will be able to be downloaded and used. However, according to the page, subscriptions won’t be renewed and will be canceled. Google is dealing with credit card processing, meaning it is expected to  still be able to give payouts to Russian developers.
The report noted Google’s blog post about what it has been doing in Ukraine. However, its continuing business in Russia has made it an outlier among the other big tech companies. That led to Google being accused by Forbes of being “Putin’s Most Compliant U.S. Tech Censor.”
Google’s activities in Russia have caused much friction with authorities in the context of the Ukraine war, with the country criticizing and accusing the company’s  YouTube video-sharing platform, which has shut out Russian state-funded media globally, of becoming “one of the key platforms spreading fakes (fake images) about the course of (Russia’s) special military operation on the territory of Ukraine…”

The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets announced a preliminary investigation into Alphabet’s Google last week, over possible anti-competitive practices in its Play store. Match group had asked the regulator to assess whether Google is abusing a dominant position in the dating app market. 
Google’s Play store policies have been questioned before, with a group of 36 US states and the District of Columbia suing the company last year over claims that its mobile app store abuses its market power and forces aggressive terms on software developers

507,"May 9, 2022","Google, Meta Avoid UK’s Publishers Deal For Another Year","


The United Kingdom was about to join a list of countries including Australia, Canada, France and Spain that imposed limits on the negotiations between Big Tech firms and publishers to use news and content on tech platforms, but a change of heart in the UK government may delay this plan at least for a year. 
On Friday (May 6), the telecommunication regulator Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority(CMA) published their joint advice to the UK government on how Big Tech companies should arrange “fairer deals” with online publishers in order to use their content. 
As in many other countries around the world, people have turned to online sources for their news, either through social media, search engines or apps provided by Google and Facebook, among other tech firms. Ofcom and CMA argue that “consumers and content providers, including newspapers, could benefit if the bargaining power of the biggest tech firms is properly managed.” 
The advice was set out in the form of a code of conduct that would mean that Big Tech firms with significant bargaining power would have to agree fair and reasonable terms for the content they use on their platforms. This code identifies a number of ways to do that, such as by addressing concerns about how algorithms work, and which factors are used to determine where different publisher’s content appears in searches, or by providing a framework for fair financial terms for the publisher’s content. 
The code would also establish that in the event of a dispute between a platform and a publisher about the application of a code, the Digital Markets Unit (DMU) would have the role of deciding whether a contract or action by the firm was compliant. As proposed in other countries, the code would also give the DMU enforcement power to impose binding arbitration to ensure code breaches do not persist for long periods. 
Notably, the UK law would differ from other countries because the code would be a set of legally binding obligations for the biggest tech firms. Additionally, unlike Australia, the proposal in the UK has a broader focus: it was intended to shape the behavior of the Big Tech companies and reduce the imbalance of bargaining power across a range of digital markets. 
However, the biggest challenge was that the new code had to first be passed into law. The government would also have had to legally authorize the DMU to be fully operational and with statutory powers. 
According to current news reports, U.K. ministers said neither the code nor the DMU will be part of the Queen’s Speech to be delivered Tuesday (May 10), when Queen Elizabeth will announce new laws for the next Parliamentary session. This means that while regulators can still work on a draft for the code and the DMU will continue assisting the CMA in existing investigations, the chances of publishing a legally binding code by the end of the year are slim. Accordingly, at present Google and Meta may not need to worry about legal restrictions when negotiating with publishers.

508,"May 9, 2022",Apple & Google Concerned With ACCC’s Proposal For Antitrust Reforms,"


Apple and Google, and the Australian industry group advocating for tech giants have unsurprisingly raised concerns about the proposed measures that were outlined in the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) discussion paper for the Digital Platforms Services inquiry.
In its discussion paper that was published in February, the country’s competition watchdog put forward a slew of legislative measures that took aim at big tech issues, including anti-competitive conduct, bargaining imbalances, insufficient consumer and business user protections, and more.
In response to those proposals, Apple expressed its discontent, describing in its submission that the proposed reforms would result in Australian consumers being “net worse off” and that it is “puzzled” about why the agency would “prioritise purported competition concerns”, which it believes “lack cogent evidence of harm, over clear and present severe damage to users that they experience every day”.
“That is not what consumers want to see as outcomes of legislative reform — they want stronger, not weaker, protection — from the unlawful conduct which affects the hundreds of thousands of Australians every year whose information is stolen, scammed, traded and exploited to their detriment,” Apple wrote.
The Cupertino company also criticised the ACCC’s reforms as being directed at addressing hypothetical, rather than existing problems, and that the changes would “regrettably” change iPhone and other Apple services, including iOS and the App Store, and result in changes to Apple’s privacy and security standards and leave existing users exposed to less secure and private environments.
“Much of the discussion paper appears to proceed on the assumption that there is a relevant market failure arising from Apple’s purported market power,” Apple said.

509,"May 4, 2022",Dutch Watchdog To Investigate Google Play Store Practices,"


The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets announced on Wednesday a preliminary investigation into Alphabet’s Google for possible anti-competitive practices in its Play store.
Tinder owner Match group had asked the regulator to assess whether Google is abusing a dominant position in the dating app market.
“Dating-app providers allegedly are no longer able to use a payment system other than Google’s payment system,” ACM spokesperson Murco Mijnlieff said in an email.
In a response, a Google spokesperson said the company charges customers 15% commissions for subscriptions via Google Play, which it said was “the lowest rate among major app platforms.”
It said app distributors can also avoid Google Play entirely by distributing their apps via other stores or websites.
The Dutch ACM remains locked in a two-year fight with Google competitor Apple over alternative means of payment for dating apps on the App Store.
Apple has received 50 million euros in fines, the maximum possible under a current court decision, for failure to comply with an ACM order to make it possible for dating app developers to offer customers non-Apple payment methods. 
On Monday the ACM said the most recent proposals by Apple to remedy the situation, on March 30, were still not sufficient and it is preparing a new order with new payment penalties.
“Once we have published this new order subject to periodic penalty payments, we can comment on the contents thereof as well as on the points on which Apple is still in non-compliance. That may take several weeks,” the ACM said.

510,"December 12, 2021",EU Praises Italy Over Amazon Fine,"


he Italian antitrust body has slapped a €1.128 billion fine on Amazon after finding that the US giant holds a position of absolute dominance in the Italian e-commerce market, which has allowed it to favor its own logistics service. The European Commission has already praised Italy’s move, while Amazon said it would appeal the decision, EURACTIV Italy reports.
The fine was slapped on a number of Amazon-controlled companies, including Amazon Europe Core, Amazon Services Europe, Amazon EU, Amazon Italia Services and Amazon Italia Logistica, for abusing their dominant position in the e-commerce logistics services industry.
Sellers are being discouraged from offering their products on other online platforms with the same range of products because sellers have access to a number of advantages to gain visibility and better sales prospects on Amazon’s Italian website – Amazon.it – when they rely on the company’s logistics service, the antitrust body also said.
The main advantage the companies get from using Amazon as a platform is the so-called Prime label that “allows to sell with more ease to the most loyal and high-spending consumers adhering to Amazon’s homonymous loyalty programme”.
This label also allows them to “participate in the special events managed by Amazon, like Black Friday, Cyber Monday or Prime Day, and increases the probability that the seller’s offer is selected as a Featured Offer and displayed in the so-called Buy Box.”
“Amazon has thus prevented third-party sellers from associating the Prime label with offers not managed with FBA,” the Italian government body also said, adding that this has prevented competing e-commerce logistics operators from presenting themselves as providers of quality services comparable to those offered by Amazon’s logistics.
“It is difficult to say whether the quantification of the penalty is adequate or not, but it seems clear that it is always easier for those who enjoy a competitive advantage in terms of data to move from a dominant position in one sector to another,” said Rocco Panetta, Internet and privacy expert and country leader for Italy in the International Association of Privacy Professionals.
The European Commission welcomed the decision.
“We are faced with an example of successful coordination between the European Commission and the Italian Authority, which was ideally placed to conduct a separate investigation into Amazon’s conduct in Italy,” it said.

511,"December 9, 2021",Italy Hits Amazon With Huge $1.28B Antitrust Fine,"


Italian antitrust regulators on Thursday slapped e-commerce giant Amazon with a massive $1.28 billion fine for abusing its market dominance, reported Reuters.
The Autorita Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato, or AGCM, said in a statement that Amazon leveraged its dominant position to illegally harm competitors in the e-commerce logistics space.
The regulators said Amazon illegally tied the use of its own logistics service, called Fulfilment by Amazon, to “access to a set of exclusive benefits essential for gaining visibility and increasing sales” on Amazon’s site in Italy.
Those benefits included access to the site’s Prime label, which makes it easier to sell to Amazon Prime subscribers and participate in Amazon’s special events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Prime Day, AGCM said.
“The investigation showed that such benefits are crucial to gain visibility, to boost sales and, in turn, to the success of sellers’ offers on Amazon.it,” the regulators said.
“In so doing, Amazon harmed competing e-commerce logistics operators, preventing them from presenting themselves to online sellers as providers of services of comparable quality to Amazon’s FBA and thus capable of ensuring high visibility on Amazon.it. Such a conduct widened the gap between Amazon’s market power and its competitors’ also in the delivery of e-commerce parcels.”

Amazon cloud computing unit on Tuesday introduced two new custom computing chips aimed at helping its customers beat the cost of using chips from Intel and Nvidia, reported Reuters. 
With $45.37 billion in sales in 2020, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s biggest cloud computing provider and one of the biggest buyers of data center chips, whose computing power AWS rents out to its customers. Ever since buying a startup called Annapurna Labs in 2015, AWS has worked to develop its own custom chips.
On Tuesday, the company released the third generation of its Graviton chip that is designed to compete with central processors from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. The Graviton3 is 25% faster than its predecessor, and Dave Brown, vice president of Elastic Compute Cloud at Amazon, told Reuters that the company expects it to provide a better performance per dollar than Intel’s chips.
AWS also said that a new class of chip called Trainium, which is designed to train machine learning computer models and will compete against chips from Nvidia, will soon be available to its customers. AWS expects it to train machine learning models for a cost that is 40% lower than Nvidia’s flagship chip.

Goldman Sachs said on Tuesday it had partnered with Amazon Web Services Inc to create a software for cloud-based data and analytics for financial institutions, reported Reuters. 
The new product, called Goldman Sachs Financial Cloud for Data, will allow hedge funds and asset managers, among other firms, with data management, analytics and security services, the bank said.
“Clients of the firm will get access to our decades of experience and data aggregation that should enable them to enhance their business decisions, both from a speed and efficiency perspective,” Solomon told CNBC last week in a phone interview. “We think that adds to our position as a leader in the marketplace.”
The new service, called GS Financial Cloud for Data with Amazon Web Services, will help asset managers save time by allowing their developers to focus efforts on trades, rather than spending time wrangling data sets and leaning on a patchwork of legacy software to analyze them, the companies said. It will also “lower the barriers to entry” for firms to use advanced quantitative trading techniques, Goldman said.

The Federal Trade Commission on Monday ordered nine large U.S. companies, including Walmart, Amazon and Procter & Gamble, to provide detailed information about their operations, in a bid to unravel the causes of the supply chain disruptions that are clouding the economic recovery, reported the The Washington Post.
The commission order, approved by a 4-0 vote, came as President Biden met at the White House with corporate chieftains in the latest display of presidential concern over supply chain snarls. The president was scheduled to speak after the meeting with the chief executives of companies such as Food Lion, Mattel and Best Buy. But the White House rescheduled his comments for Wednesday, saying the president wanted to spend more time with the CEOs.
The White House and some independent analysts have blamed a lack of competition throughout the supply chain for many of the current problems, which are fueling inflation and depressing the president’s public approval ratings. Biden this summer issued an executive order calling for regulators to crack down on consolidation in the ocean shipping and freight rail industries as part of a broader competition initiative.
“We’ve had an incredible amount of consolidation in the supply chain. … That’s why it’s been unable to withstand the kind of shock we’ve seen with the pandemic,” said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute. “We are now learning the hard way what 40 years of unbridled consolidation and lax merger enforcement mean.”

The approval for the deal was a “nullity in the eyes of law” as an arbitrator’s order was still in force, according to the letter sent by Amazon to the Competition Commission of India (CCI) last week.

Support for curbing large technology companies’ market power is widening in the Senate, with lawmakers in both parties endorsing new legal constraints on search engines, e-marketplaces, app stores and other online platforms.

The measures must overcome a stepped-up lobbying effort in opposition from companies including Google,Amazon and Apple which say many of the proposals will hurt consumers who have grown dependent on their products and services.

Amazon has asked India’s Supreme Court to pause an expedited review of allegations that the US firm concealed information while seeking antitrust clearance for a 2019 deal with India’s Future Group, legal papers seen by Reuters showed.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in June accused Amazon of concealing facts and making false submissions when it sought approval for the $200 million investment into a Future unit in 2019, a deal that is now at the heart of protracted legal disputes between the two sides.
Amazon told Reuters at the time that it was confident of addressing the watchdog’s concerns. The Supreme Court approach by Amazon comes as the CCI on Wednesday held a closed-door hearing where the US firm’s lawyers declined to argue and explain their position on the matter, saying they had asked the top court to pause the process.

Italy’s antitrust authority has fined US tech giants Amazon and Apple a total of more than 200 million euros ($225 million) for alleged anti-competitive cooperation in the sale of Apple and Beats products, reportes Reuters.
Contractual provisions of a 2018 agreement between the companies meant only selected resellers were allowed to sell Apple and Beats products on Amazon.it, the watchdog said, adding that this was in violation of European Union rules and affected competition on prices.
Both Apple and Amazon told Reuters they plan to appeal against the fines.
The authority imposed a fine of 68.7 million euros on Amazon and 134.5 million euros on Apple, ordering the companies to end the restrictions to give retailers of genuine Apple and Beats products access to Amazon.it in a non-discriminatory manner.
“To ensure our customers purchase genuine products, we work closely with our reseller partners and have dedicated teams of experts around the world who work with law enforcement, customs and merchants to ensure only genuine Apple products are being sold,” Apple said, denying any wrongdoing.
In a separate statement Amazon said it strongly disagreed with the decision of the Italian authority and that the proposed fine was “disproportionate and unjustified”.

Amazon announced the $8.45 billion deal in May, saying the purchase of the fabled US movie studio, home to the James Bond franchise, would give it a library of films and TV shows to compete with rivals like Netflix and Disney+.
Related: Amazon’s $6.4B MGM Acquisition Probed By FTC
The unions, in a report by an entity they support called the Strategic Organizing Center, argued that the deal would bring Amazon’s industry-leading streaming library to more than 55,000 titles, with more under development, which would give the company greater incentive to discriminate against rivals. Netflix has the second-greatest number of titles at just under 20,000, the letter said.
“The prospect of Amazon acquiring a trove of additional MGM content to build on Amazon’s existing vast library should raise alarm bells,” the group said. “With control over MGM’s vast library, Amazon may acquire enough market power over streaming content to raise prices for (streaming video-on-demand) SVOD competitors or for SVOD consumers.”

Facebook’s acquisition of US customer service startup Kustomer may hurt competition and boost its market power in online advertising, European Union antitrust regulators warned on Monday, August 2, as they opened a full-scale investigation into the deal.
The move by the European Commission comes amid regulatory concerns on both sides of the Atlantic that a buying spree of startups by big firms, which normally don’t trigger competition scrutiny because of the low value of the deal, may be so-called killer acquisitions aimed at closing down nascent rivals.
Facebook, the world’s largest social network, announced the purchase of Kustomer to scale up its instant messaging app WhatsApp in November last year.
The EU executive, which acts as the bloc’s competition enforcer, said the deal may result in Facebook blocking rivals’ access to its units WhatsApp, Messenger, or Instagram, which are key to customer relationship management (CRM) software.
Kustomer sells CRM software to businesses so they can communicate with consumers by phone, email, text messages, WhatsApp, Instagram, and other channels.

The states argued that Facebook violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by blocking interoperability for certain apps. The argument was dismissed by Judge James E. Boasberg, an Obama-era nominee, because the actions took place more than five years ago.

Facebook’s acquisition of US customer service startup Kustomer is set to trigger a full-scale EU antitrust investigation next month, three people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The world’s largest social network, which announced the deal in November, is looking to the deal to scale up its instant messaging app WhatsApp, whose usage has soared during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The European Commission will conclude its preliminary review of the deal on Aug. 2 after which it will begin an in-depth 90-day investigation, reported Reuters. 
Facebook has until July 26 to offer concessions to stave off the investigation but is unlikely to do so because of the difficulty of finding the right remedies to address competition concerns, the people said on condition of anonymity.
Facebook referred to its June statement, which said the deal is pro-competitive and will bring more innovation to businesses and consumers.
The EU competition enforcer took over the case, citing a rarely used power known as Article 22 that gives it some discretion, and following an Austrian request even though the deal falls below the EU turnover threshold.
The EU watchdog’s scrutiny of small deals coincides with regulatory concerns on both sides of the Atlantic that a buying spree of start-ups by big companies, which do not trigger competition scrutiny because of the low value of the deal, may be so-called killer acquisitions, meaning they kill off potential competitors before they are big enough to be a threat.

The complainant also claimed that Apple’s 30% in-app fee on the distribution of paid digital content had been harming competition.

In an earlier filing, Apple denied the allegations, stating it wanted the regulator to throw the case out. Apple stated its Indian market share was between 0-5%, which it called “insignificant.”
However, CCI stated Apple’s arguments were misdirected and that the allegations concerned anti-competitive restrictions on app developers, rather than end-users.
Apple, along with other tech giants, has been facing adversity from numerous countries around the globe as of late.

531,"January 2, 2022",Indian Watchdog Probes Apple Over App Market Abuse,"


On Friday, India’s antitrust regulator ordered an investigation into Apple’s business practices in the country, saying it was of the initial view that the iPhone maker had violated certain antitrust laws, reported Reuters. 
India’s Competition Commission of India (CCI) order comes after a non-profit group alleged this year that Apple was abusing its dominant position in the apps market by forcing developers to use its proprietary in-app purchase system.
The complainant, “Together We Fight Society”, argued that Apple’s imposition of a 30% in-app fee for distribution of paid digital content and other restrictions hurts competition by raising costs for app developers and customers, while also acting as a barrier to market entry.

The CCI said Apple’s restrictions prima facie result in denial of market access for potential app developers and distributors.
“The Commission at this stage is convinced that a prima facie case is made out against Apple which merits investigation,” it said.
The company denied the allegations in a filing to the CCI last month, seen by Reuters, and asked the regulator to throw out the case, stressing that its market share in India was an “insignificant” 0-5%.
CCI however said in the order that Apple’s argument on its market share was “completely misdirected” as the allegations were about anti-competitive restrictions on app developers and not end-users.

The Netherlands’ top competition regulator said Apple broke the country’s competition laws and ordered changes to the iPhone maker’s App Store payment policies, reported Reters.
Apple’s practice of requiring app developers to use its in-app payment system and pay commissions of 15% to 30% on digital goods purchases has come under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world.
An investigation by the Netherlands’ Authority for Consumers and Markets on whether Apple’s practices amounted to an abuse of a dominant market position was launched in 2019. But it was later reduced in scope to focus primarily on dating market apps, including Tinder owner Match Group.Related: Netherlands Antitrust Regulator Nears Decision On App Store Case
“We disagree with the order issued by the ACM and have filed an appeal,” Apple said in a statement. It added that “Apple does not have a dominant position in the market for software distribution in the Netherlands, has invested tremendous resources helping developers of dating apps reach customers and thrive on the App Store.”The regulator’s decision said Apple violated competition laws.

533,"December 13, 2021",Poland Probes Apple Over App Tracking Transparency Rules,"


Apple is being investigated by a regulator in Poland over App Tracking Transparency for iOS, with the privacy initiative being called potentially anti-competitive. 
The introduction of App Tracking Transparency to iOS has helped improve the privacy of Apple’s users, by reducing the amount of data third-party firms can collect from apps. While it has received criticism from advertising-centric companies and the industry at large, it is now being probed by a regulator over competition fears. 
Polish antimonopoly watchdog UOKiK announced the investigation into Apple, looking into the ATT rules relating to privacy and personal data processing, to determine if it violates competition law. According to the regulator, the rules considerably reduced the ability for third-party apps to get hold of data about the user, which could be used to serve targeted ads.
“We want to examine whether Apple’s actions may be aimed at eliminating competitors in the market for personalized advertising services, the objective being to better sell their own service” said UOKiK president Tomasz Chrostny. “We will investigate whether this is a case of exclusionary abuse of market power.” 
Apple has previously been accused of using its privacy claims to increase its profits, while at the same time costing advertisers billions in revenue. At the same time, Apple’s own in-house advertising arm is thought to be enjoying more revenue as a result, with analysts forecasting 2021 advertising revenues of $5 billion, rising to $20 billion within three years.

534,"December 8, 2021",Appeals Court Gives Apple Last-Minute Reprieve From App Store Changes During ‘Fortnite’ Case ,"


Apple on Wednesday won a reprieve from having to make major changes to its lucrative App Store while it appeals an antitrust lawsuit brought by “Fortnite” creator Epic Games.
In September, a US judge ordered Apple to change its App Store rules, which ban developers from including links in buttons to outside payment systems rather than using Apple’s own in-app payments that charge a commission on sales. The injunction was set to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time on Thursday.
But with just slightly more than 12 hours remaining before the deadline, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted Apple’s request to pause the order.
The appeals court order means Apple will not have to make the changes while it pursues a potentially years-long appeal of the Epic Games decision, which was largely favorable to the iPhone maker aside from the order to allow buttons to outside payment methods. The lower court did not find that Apple violated any antitrust laws, but said the company broke California’s unfair competition law by not allowing developers to tell consumers about alternative ways to pay for software.
“Apple has demonstrated, at minimum, that its appeal raises serious questions on the merits of the district court’s determination,” the 9th Circuit Court wrote on Wednesday.

The US Department of Justice is looking for instances in which Apple is unevenly enforcing rules for app developers such as gaming firm Roblox and some others, the Information reported on Monday.
The DOJ is probing key revelations from the antitrust trial between Apple and Epic Games in May, according to the report, in which the “Fortnite” maker had argued that Apple had given a free pass to Roblox, whose app lets people pick from a selection of games to play.
Following this, Roblox had removed reference to the word “game” and changed it to “experiences”, the Information reported.
The DOJ recently asked Roblox why it made the language change and also wants to know whether Apple’s 2019 launch of its Arcade game app store made it more difficult for game developers to compete with the iPhone maker, according to the report.
The tech news website had reported in late October that the DOJ was accelerating its two-year-old antitrust probe on Apple in the last several months, increasing the likelihood of a lawsuit.

Apple has started legal proceedings against Russia’s anti-monopoly regulator in a dispute concerning alternative payment options on its App Store platform, the RIA news agency reported on Sunday citing court filings.
Russia opened an antitrust case against Apple in late October, accusing it of failing to allow app developers to tell customers about alternative payment options when using its App Store. It said Apple could face a fine based on its revenue in Russia if found guilty.

Apple vs Epic Games will go to trial in Australia next year after an Australian High Court refused Apple’s last-ditch attempt to stall the case, reported the AAP. 
Tech giant Apple has lost a bid to prevent a case being heard in Australia that alleges it misused its market power over a popular online game.
The High Court in Canberra on Thursday refused Apple special leave to appeal against a Federal Court judgment that prevented the American multinational corporation from staying Epic Games’ litigation in Australian courts.
Related: Australia Moves Epic Games Antitrust Lawsuit Against Apple Forward
A court in Sydney had previously granted Apple’s request to delay the case, stating it should be filed in the U.S. as stipulated by the contract between Apple and Epic. However, a court in July overturned that ruling, and a Federal court backed up the move.
Epic Games sued Apple in Australia last year, at the time stating that “Apple’s conduct in its App Store is a misuse of market power and substantially lessens competition in-app distribution and payment processes.” CEO Tim Sweeney said the matter “goes to the heart of whether consumers and creators can do business together directly on mobile platforms or are forced to use monopoly channels against wishes and interests.”
Meanwhile, in the US, Apple has renewed a bid to stop an injunction passed down by the court in the U.S. theatre of the legal battle, asking the Ninth Circuit to stay the injunction. Apple is asking a higher court to halt a judge’s decision that will force changes to its App Store while a legal fight with Epic Games continues, reported Bloomberg. 
Lawyers for the company filed Tuesday with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, seeking action by Dec. 8.

Italy’s antitrust regulator has fined Google and iPhone maker Apple 10 million euros ($11.2 million) each for “aggressive practices” linked to the commercial use of user data, reported Reuters. 
The authority said in a statement the two tech groups did not provide “clear and immediate information” on how they collect and use the data of those who access their services.
Both Google and Apple said they disagreed with the antitrust decision and that they would appeal it.
The watchdog said that when users set up their account with Google, the system was designed in such a way that the terms and conditions on data usage were set up to be accepted.
In the case of Apple, users do not have a choice on the issue, the antitrust regulator added.
“We provide industry-leading transparency and control to all users, so they can choose what information to share or not, and how it’s used,” Apple said in a statement, describing the regulator’s view as “wrong”.
Google said in a statement it followed “fair and transparent practices to provide users with useful services, as well as provide clear information on their use”.

Support for curbing large technology companies’ market power is widening in the Senate, with lawmakers in both parties endorsing new legal constraints on search engines, e-marketplaces, app stores and other online platforms.

540,"September 9, 2020",Slack Fears Retaliation From Microsoft For Making Antitrust Complaint,"


Two months ago, Slack filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission against Microsoft for bundling Microsoft Teams with Office 365, and in a recent filing, the company revealed that they are concerned about retaliation by Microsoft due to this.
The concern was revealed in their latest 10-Q filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission which noted “Furthermore, we could be subject to retaliatory or other adverse measures by Microsoft, its employees, or agents in response to the complaint that we filed with the European Commission.”
The San Francisco-based company has been outspoken in its criticism of Microsoft, accusing the Redmond company of illegally bundling its Teams software with its widely used Office apps. It’s common for companies to caution investors about standard risks and uncertainties associated with such legal actions. But the new filing takes Slack’s public statements against Microsoft to another level, going beyond its core allegations to warn that its larger rival could strike back in an unspecified way against Slack for making those claims, reported GeekWire. 
The filing also stated, “Slack currently interoperates with Microsoft products, including Teams, in limited capacities but it is possible that Microsoft may be uncooperative with any future efforts for Slack to interoperate with Teams or other Microsoft products, which could limit Slack’s functionality and make Slack less attractive to users of Microsoft products.”

Walmart said it has held discussions with Microsoft about partnering with the software giant in its pursuit of TikTok’s US operations, the latest big company to enter the chase for the popular short video-sharing app, reported NPR.
The Trump administration has pushed TikTok’s owner, Chinese technology giant ByteDance, to sell its American operations after targeting the app over national-security concerns. Microsoft, Oracle and Twitter  have all been named as possible buyers of its operations in North America, Australia and New Zealand.
“The way TikTok has integrated e-commerce and advertising capabilities in other markets is a clear benefit to creators and users in those markets,” Walmart said in a statement. 
“We believe a potential relationship with TikTok US in partnership with Microsoft could add this key functionality and provide Walmart with an important way for us to reach and serve omnichannel customers as well as grow our third-party marketplace and advertising businesses,” Walmart said.
Walmart said a potential partnership with Microsoft would address US government concerns about TikTok. Walmart and Microsoft are already partners on several technology projects, with the retailer using Microsoft’s cloud computing services, as they seek a counterweight to Amazon.

542,"August 6, 2020",Microsoft Now Looks Towards TikTok’s Global Business,"


Microsoft is chasing a deal to buy all of TikTok’s global business, including the viral video app’s operations in India and Europe, reported The Financial Times.
The US software company announced on Sunday, August 2, it was in negotiations with ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, to explore “a purchase of the TikTok service in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.” But Microsoft has since also pursued a plan that would include all countries where TikTok operates. 
TikTok does not operate in China, and such a deal would not extend to its China-facing sister app Douyin. Meanwhile, Microsoft executives have sought to assuage the Chinese government as it seeks to avoid being caught in crossfire between Beijing and Washington, two people said. One person close to Microsoft pushed back on the suggestion that the US tech group was discussing asset swaps in China as part of a deal.
The shift from Sunday underscores how preliminary the talks between the two sides remain as they race to meet a mid-September deadline to reach a deal and prevent TikTok from being banned in the US.  
One person close to ByteDance’s Asia-Pacific operations suggested that Microsoft had been attracted to the idea of buying all of TikTok’s global business by the difficulty of separating back-office functions such as HR and to ensure that TikTok users in one country could still use the app if they travelled to another.

President Trump gave his verbal approval to a potential deal between TikTok and an American company like Microsoft on Monday, but said TikTok had until Sept. 15 to close such a deal or face a US ban, reported Fox News. 
“Here’s the deal. I don’t mind if, whether it’s Microsoft or somebody else, a big company, a secure company, a very American company buys it,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “It’s probably easier to buy the whole thing than to buy 30 percent of it. … Who’s going to get the name, the name is hot?”
The Trump administration has been weighing TikTok’s fate since last year, launching an investigation into the short video company amid fears that its Bejing-based parent ByteDance shares customer information with the Communist Chinese government.
“The question is, given China’s civil-military infusion … can we trust any company that operates in China, has servers in China, has software in China, to protect your children?” Navarro told Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom” on Monday.
ByteDance entered into talks about a month ago with Microsoft to buy TikTok’s US operations as a way to save the business from a decision by the administration that would prevent the popular app from being used by US consumers.
Microsoft confirmed Sunday that it was in talks over a potential TikTok purchase.
“Microsoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the President’s concerns,” the company said in a statement. “It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury.”

Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella spoke with US President Donald Trump on Sunday to salvage the company’s effort to buy TikTok’s operations in the US and several other countries, reported The Wall Street Journal.Microsoft, in a blog post Sunday, said it would move quickly to pursue discussions with TikTok parent Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., over a potential purchase and aims to complete the negotiations by Sept. 15.
The statement, which was the software giant’s first confirmation it was interested in acquiring TikTok’s US business, said the deal talks also entail the app’s service in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
US officials have expressed concerns that TikTok could pass on the data it collects from Americans to China’s authoritarian government. TikTok has said it would never do so. Officials also worry that the app could be used to spread Chinese propaganda and that the platform’s moderators are censoring content to appease Beijing.The Wall Street Journal and other outlets Friday reported Microsoft’s interests in the deal. Soon after, Mr. Trump said he opposed a transaction and that he preferred to ban the app, temporarily pausing the talks between Microsoft and ByteDance and throwing uncertainty over the discussions.
“Microsoft appreciates the US Government’s and President Trump’s personal involvement as it continues to develop strong security protections for the country,” the company said in its statement. The Redmond, Wash.-based company said it would continue the dialogue with the US government, including the president, as talks progress.
With TikTok, Microsoft said in its statement Sunday, it would ensure the data of American TikTok users would be transferred to the US where it would remain and that it would ensure that data from Americans stored overseas would be deleted once transferred. Microsoft said that TikTok, under its ownership, would build on the popular user experience while adding privacy and security protections.

545,"July 22, 2020",Slack Files Competition Complaint Against Microsoft In The EU,"


Slack has filed an anti-competitive complaint against Microsoft with the European Commission. “The complaint details Microsoft’s illegal and anti-competitive practice of abusing its market dominance to extinguish competition in breach of European Union competition law,” reported The Wall Street Journal.
Slack alleges that Microsoft has “illegally tied” its Microsoft Teams product to Office and is “force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers.”
“Microsoft is reverting to past behavior,” claims David Schellhase, general counsel at Slack. “They created a weak, copycat product and tied it to their dominant Office product, force installing it and blocking its removal, a carbon copy of their illegal behavior during the ‘browser wars.’ Slack is asking the European Commission to take swift action to ensure Microsoft cannot continue to illegally leverage its power from one market to another by bundling or tying products.”
Microsoft claimed Slack doesn’t have the “breadth and depth” to reinvent work, and Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield has previously said that Microsoft is “unhealthily preoccupied with killing us.”
The competition between the two companies first began nearly four years ago when Slack paid for a full-page newspaper ad to “welcome” Microsoft Teams as a competitor. Microsoft overtook Slack usage a year ago, and has hit big user numbers recently thanks to pandemic-related demand. Microsoft revealed it had 75 million daily active users of Microsoft Teams back in April, and the company may well update that figure during its earnings call later today.

Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith reportedly expressed concerns about the Apple App Store in a meeting with the US House antitrust committee investigating dominant tech companies.
The meeting came a few weeks before the House’s Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee is set to grill prominent tech executives like Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Alphabet and Google CEO Sundai Pichai.
Amid the ongoing antitrust probe, the committee met with Smith via videoconference earlier in the summer, The Information reported. According to sources familiar with the meeting, the primary goal was to get Microsoft’s perspective as a major technology company that has faced past antitrust regulation. 
But The Information notes that Smith also discussed some of Microsoft’s “concerns” about how Apple operates its App Store — an issue at the forefront of the House committee’s investigation.
Specifically, the concerns centered on the “arbitrariness of Apple’s practices around approving apps, while also criticizing Apple’s requirement that developers use the company’s payment mechanism through their apps.” Smith did not levy any criticisms against other tech companies, sources claimed.
Spotify, Basecamp and other companies have complained about Apple’s 15% to 30% cut of in-app purchases made through its payment system. In June, the House antitrust chairperson called the fees “highway robbery.”
Apple, for its part, says that those fees are meant to ensure consistency across the App Store — not to generate excess profits.

But Warner’s parent, AT&T, hasn’t yet decided whether to sell the business.

Alphabet unit Google on Monday urged Europe’s second-highest court to dismiss a 1.49-billion-euro ($1.6 billion) fine imposed by EU antitrust regulators three years ago for hindering rivals in online search advertising, reported Reuters. 
The case is one of three that has resulted in a total of 8.25 billion euros in European Union antitrust fines on the world’s most popular internet search engine.
The European Commission in its 2019 decision said Google had abused its dominance to stop websites using brokers other than its AdSense platform which provided search adverts. The Commission said the illegal practices occurred from 2006 to 2016.
Google subsequently challenged the EU finding in the Luxembourg-based General Court. The company will set out its case during a three-day hearing starting on Monday.
The EU competition enforcer’s assessment of Google’s dominance and the Commission’s decision that search ads and non-search ads do not compete were wrong, Google said in a court document.
It also took issue with the Commission for saying the company’s exclusivity, premium placement and minimum Google ads clauses were abusive.
Google suffered a setback last year when it lost its court fight against a 2.42-billion-euro antitrust decision over the use of its own price comparison shopping service to gain an unfair advantage over smaller European rivals.

Google is still firing AI researchers amid criticism of its work. The New York Times has learned Google fired machine learning scientist Satrajit Chatterjee in March, soon after it refused to publish a paper Chatterjee and others wrote challenging earlier findings that computers could design some chip components more effectively than humans. The scientist was reportedly allowed to collaborate on a paper disputing those claims after he and fellow authors expressed reservations, but was dismissed after a resolution committee rejected the paper and the researchers hoped to bring the issue to CEO Sundar Pichai and Alphabet’s board of directors.
The company hasn’t detailed why it fired Chatterjee, but told the Times he’d been “terminated with cause.” It also maintained that the original paper had been “thoroughly vetted” and peer-reviewed, and that the study challenging the claims “did not meet our standards.”
Whether or not the science holds up, the exit underscores the ongoing clash between Google’s management and the AI teams that drive many of its projects. The problems began in earnest when Google fired ethicist Timnit Gebru in 2020 following a dispute over a paper, with two others following suit. The matter escalated when the internet giant terminated Margaret Mitchell in early 2021. While Google claimed Mitchell violated data confidentiality policies, she also publicly criticized executives and the decision to fire Gebru. These firings led veteran engineers to leave the firm and demand reforms, and that’s not including company-wide protests over military contracts. Google investigated Gebru’s firing and promised changes, but the Chatterjee firing might not ease tensions.

552,"May 1, 2022",Bandcamp Joins Epic Games Case Against Google,"


Epic and Google are gearing up for another legal battle. You might recall that Google has an in-app billing crackdown coming to the Play Store soon. The new rules require all apps selling digital goods to use Google Play Billing by March 31, so Google gets a cut of the sales. Any app in non-compliance has been unable to ship updates since March 31, but the real deadline is June 1, when these apps will be removed from the Play Store. Epic Games bought the popular independent music site Bandcamp in March, and it’s already taking Google to court over its newest acquisition. Bandcamp isn’t in compliance with the billing rules, so it’s due for a ban in June. As part of its antitrust case against Google, Epic is filing a motion for a preliminary injunction to block Bandcamp’s de-listing from the Play Store.
Epic has gone afterGoogle and Apple over their app store rules and what Epic says are excessive fees. In March, there were a lot of questions surrounding why the creator of Fortnite and the Unreal Engine would buy an independent music site. One line of commentary from Music Business Worldwide founder Tim Ingham seems to have nailed Epic’s strategy. Ingham notes that Epic failed to get Apple to reduce its 30 percent app store cut, in part because the alternative model Epic could demonstrate to the court, the Epic Games Store and its 12 percent fee, wasn’t profitable. Apple’s lawyers argued the unprofitability of Epic’s Games Store justified Apple’s 30 percent fees.
Bandcamp is a profitable digital content business, though. Bandcamp has a searchable content store, and it hosts and delivers the content by charging artists a 10 to 15 percent commission. Ingham predicted Epic would hold up Bandcamp’s business model as a viable alternative to Apple and Google’s app store fees, and that Epic would use its new acquisition to attack app store owners. It looks like we’re seeing the first actions of that plan.

A Russian court has threatened US Internet giant Google and Wikipedia owner Wikimedia Foundation with fines for failing to delete what it said was “fake” information about the Ukraine conflict, Interfax news agency reported on Friday.
Russia’s communications watchdog said on Thursday that Google would face fines over its failure to delete from video sharing site YouTube content that Moscow considers illegal.
The developments come after Russia had warned Wikipedia to take down “material with inaccurate information of public interest” on the Ukraine war on April 5. Roskomnadzor had claimed that the internet open-source website was hosting untrue data on what the Kremlin calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine. Subsequently, Wikipedia was allegedly disseminating wrong details about the Russian troops’ actions in its embattled ex-Soviet neighbour.
This is not the first time Moscow has slapped strapping fines on US-based internet and social media companies, accusing them of violating online media regulations in Russian. Last December, Facebook’s parent company Meta received a 1.9 billion rouble ($27 million) court fine for “systematic failure to remove banned content” from its platform. 
At the time, the Tagansky District Court too ruled that Google had neglected the provisions of Russian media laws, leading them to face an administrative penalty worth 7.2 billion roubles (approx. $98.4 million). Earlier Russia had imposed fines on social media companies but December 2021 was the first time the penalties were based on the revenues of the defendants.

555,"April 14, 2022",Google Faces Antitrust Suit Over Waze Acquisition,"


Alphabet is facing federal antitrust litigation in San Francisco over claims that it leverages its dominance of the GPS navigation market—through Google Maps, Waze, and related services—to lock app developers into the “Google ecosystem” and hit them with “egregious” price hikes.
The lawsuit accuses Google of capturing 81% of the market by offering Maps for free, exploiting its data “treasure trove” to cement its monopoly, placing restrictive terms on developers that incorporate its functions, and using other services like search and YouTube to favor Maps by “self-preferencing.”
After Google’s control of the “digital-mapping stack” was complete following its 2013 acquisition of Waze—the only rival offering a full suite of competing services—it began jacking up prices, which have risen by 1,400% since 2018, according to the proposed class action brought by three businesses.
The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, also indirectly challenges the Waze deal—which has recently come under belated scrutiny from antitrust regulators—although it doesn’t seek to unwind the transaction.
The tech giant “bought out one of the few companies in the world making navigable maps while also providing turn-by-turn navigation service” and “bureaucratized” it “into a failing subsidiary” that could be used as a “guinea pig” for monetizing GPS services through advertising, the complaint says.

556,"April 14, 2022",Google May Face Russian Fines Over Content On YouTube,"


Russia’s communications watchdog said on Thursday that Google will face fines over its failure to delete from video sharing site YouTube contentthat Moscow considers illegal.
Roskomnadzor accused Google’s YouTube video-sharing platform, which has shut out Russian state-funded media globally, of becoming “one of the key platforms spreading fakes (fake images) about the course of (Russia’s) special military operation on the territory of Ukraine, discrediting the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation”.
It said the measures against Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., which include a warning in search engines saying it is violating Russian law, would remain in place until it complied with legislation.
The deputy head of the State Duma parliamentary committee on information policy, Anton Gorelkin, wrote on Telegram that the Russian search engine Yandex would add a warning to Google services.

557,"April 10, 2022",German Watchdog Welcomes Google’s “Reject All’ Cookie Plan,"


Google’s plan to include a “reject all” button on cookie banners after its existing policy violated EU law was welcomed by Hamburg’s top data protection official, who presented his activity report on Thursday (7 April) EURACTIV Germany reports.
Google will likely first introduce such a button in France, which has already imposed fines on the US giant and Facebook, before launching it in Germany.
“Google has told us that they now want to establish this ‘reject all’ button step by step in the European Union, Switzerland and the UK,” Hamburg’s Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information Thomas Fuchs said on Wednesday (6 April) during a presentation of his 2021 activity report.
Read More: Revising the Competition Law Rulebook for Digital Markets in Europe
Fuchs now plans to also approach Facebook, which like Google has its German headquarters in Hamburg – bringing the company under his remit.
Google’s step comes in response to massive criticism and fines. The US giant’s previous argument that consenting to cookies with a single click requires far less effort than rejecting them is not in line with data protection law requirements.
Google said that by 2023 it would give up the use of cookies from third-party providers. Instead, the company is working on Topics API, where no more data will be transferred to third-party providers or Google’s servers.
Europe’s recent changes to privacy policies has brought many of the Big Tech companies that dominate the internet into hot water due to their policies for handling data, with France slapping Google and Facebook with significant fines over its Cookies policies earlier this year, in what may eventually be used as precedent for any upcoming German challenges.

558,"April 7, 2022","Canada Will Force Google, Facebook To Pay For News","


Canada’s government announced a new legislative proposal on Tuesday (April 5) that would compel platforms like Facebook and Google to negotiate with news publishers and pay them for using their content. 
By enacting this new legislation, Canada joins other countries, including Australia, France and Spain, that require Big Tech to negotiate with news publishers and pay for their content. Other countries like the UK could adopt soon similar legislation.
Under the new “Online News Act” firms like Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and Facebook parent Meta, would be required to pay Canadian media publishers for permitting connections to news content on their platforms. Canadian publishers have long lobbied the government for such a move, claiming that the advertising revenue that used to be the lifeblood of their operations has disproportionately migrated to global web behemoths.
The proposed legislation, according to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, would be comparable to Australia’s law, but would include public reporting requirements and give an independent committee, rather than the minister, the power to choose which enterprises are eligible for payments.
Read On: The European and U.S. Approaches to Antitrust and Tech: Setting the Record Straight
Australia was one of the first countries to adopt a law forcing Alphabet and Meta to pay media companies for content on their platforms, and it has been used by other countries as a model to follow. However, the Australian law goes somewhat further than other legislations, including Europe’s. For instance, in European countries like in France or Spain, Alphabet and Meta can negotiate with individual publishers, but it is up to the parties to reach an agreement and set the terms.
In contrast, Australia’s law kicks in only when negotiations between the tech giants and media companies fail. The legislation establishes an arbitration system that may impose binding rulings on the prices Google and Facebook must pay news publishers for content hosted on their platforms. Additionally, before updating algorithms that have an influence on traffic to news websites, the platforms are required give at least 14 days’ notice. Last, if any corporation violates non-discrimination terms, financial penalties may be applied.
The Canadian law seeks to replicate this model, but if negotiations between platforms and news publishers fail, a binding arbitration process will determine the compensation, rather than the government. The new law would exclude YouTube as this fall under the country’s broadcasting laws. The law will not apply either to Apple News that already license articles from publishers.
More countries around the world are trying to “level the playing field” between Big Tech and media companies. The U.K. announced in January that it is drawing up laws to require Alphabet and Meta to pay newspapers and media for their stories. Similar to the Canadian law, an independent arbitrator would step in to set a fair price if an agreement cannot be reached.

559,"April 7, 2022",French Court Upholds Google Ad Fine,"


A French court of appeals upheld a 150 million euro fine levied against Alphabet’s Google for abusing its power over the treatment of advertisers, a spokesperson for the U.S. firm said on Thursday.
France’s antitrust watchdog, which levied the fine in 2019, said in its decision then that Google applied opaque advertising rules and changed them at will. 
It was the first penalty imposed by the competition authority against Google. 
“Following the (French competition authority’s) original decision we already made some changes to make these policies even clearer and will now study the court’s ruling in detail and consider our next steps,” Google’s spokesperson said.
Two of the watchdog’s orders that accompanied the 150 million-euro fine were overturned, Google said. 
The first revoked an order that compelled it to put in place a tool allowing French consumers to file complaints. The second overturned order made it compulsory for Google to issue an annual report detailing the number of websites whose Google Ads accounts were suspended for breaching its rules and the nature of the rules that were breached.

560,"November 22, 2021",Visa Plans To Negotiate With Amazon Over High Fees,"


Visa’s chief executive called Amazon’s decision to ban UK-issued credit cards from its platform “odd” and “unfortunate,” but said he expects the spat to be resolved. 
“Clearly, we’re in a challenging negotiation,” Al Kelly told the Financial Times. “What’s different here is that Amazon unfortunately decided to take the negotiation challenges that we’re having public and oddly has chosen to threaten to punish consumers.” Amazon on Wednesday notified customers it would stop accepting UK-issued Visa credit cards starting next year and offered affected customers £20 off their next purchase using an alternative payment method. The retailer also said it was weighing dropping Visa as the partner for its co-branded card in the US.

“This should not be considered a shock, as Amazon has been using every negotiating tactic available to bring down the cost of processing payments,” Autonomous analyst Kenneth Suchoski wrote in a note that said Amazon’s move would have little impact on Visa’s bottom line.
Amazon told UK customers it was acting because of Visa’s high fees. However, Mastercard and Visa set nearly identical transactions fees in the UK, according to payments firm Bambora. “I find it quite odd that they’re claiming they did this because of the high cost of acceptance of these in the UK,” Kelly said. “It’s just absolutely inaccurate.”

According to a press release, Amazon will stop accepting Visa credit cards issued in the United Kingdom from next year because of the high transaction fees charged.
“As a result of Visa’s continued high cost of payments, we regret that Amazon will no longer accept UK-issued Visa credit cards as of 19 January, 2022,” an Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
“We continue to work toward a resolution, so our cardholders can use their preferred Visa credit cards at Amazon UK without Amazon-imposed restrictions come January 2022.”
Since Brexit, an EU-enforced cap on fees charged by card issuers is no longer in place in the UK.
The move by Amazon, earlier reported by Bloomberg News, has prompted the UK Trade Commission to call on the government to improve the UK-EU trade agreement and analysts to call on British regulators to look into the fees in the credit card market.

An Indian court ruled that the country’s antitrust body has two weeks to decide whether Amazon misled authorities while seeking approval for a 2019 deal with India’s Future, reported WTVB.
The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said in a statement it had filed the case to the Delhi High Court on Monday and the ruling was made on Tuesday.
Amazon and Future, India’s second-largest retailer, have been locked in a legal battle since last year. The e-commerce giant successfully blocked Future’s bid to sell its retail assets to rival Reliance for $3.4 billion, accusing its partner of breaching some pre-existing agreements.
Related: India’s Future Files New Antitrust Case Against Amazon
Future, which denies any wrongdoing and fears liquidation if it fails to sell assets, has been arguing before the Competition Commission of India (CCI) that approval for the 2019 Amazon deal should be revoked as the U.S. firm had made misleading representations while seeking approval. Amazon has said it is confident of addressing such regulatory concerns.
On Tuesday, the CAIT said the antitrust body should not delay deciding on the matter, which has ramifications for the public interest and could hit their businesses if the Future-Reliance deal fails.
A two-judge panel said the CCI must decide on the dispute between Amazon and Future within two weeks, the retailer group said in its statement, adding that “traders should not be made a scapegoat or suffer any financial loss.”

JD.com plans to increase investment overseas, one of its top executives told CNBC, as Chinese e-commerce giants look to tap international users.
The technology giant has been less aggressive than its rival Alibaba in expanding its presence overseas. But international expansion from both Chinese firms could challenge the e-commerce dominance of Amazon in certain parts of the world
Over the coming years, JD.com will “increase investment in countries that conform to JD’s strategies, no matter if it is on warehousing, logistics or supply chain,” Xin Lijun, the newly-appointed chief executive of JD’s retail business said in Mandarin, according to a CNBC translation.
JD also operates Joybuy.com for international customers. It is a rival to Alibaba’s AliExpress. Xin said that JD’s logistics arm has been leading the international expansion efforts for the group, which is different to other companies.
“This is the biggest difference in terms of global expansion compared with other companies. What we provide is integrated and closed-loop services. This is what enables us to perform generally well in overseas markets,” Xin said.

Currently, Amazon faces two EU antitrust investigations which they wish to settle to avoid hefty fines, reported Reuters.
In November of last year, the European Commission charged Amazon with using its size, power, and data to push its own products and gain an unfair advantage over rival merchants that sell on its online platform.
Vestager also opened an investigation into Amazon’s possible preferential treatment of its own retail offers and those of marketplace sellers that use its logistics and delivery services.

Amazon is engaged in preliminary discussions with the EU competition enforcer and has offered concessions to address their concerns, the people said.
According to Reuters, the settlement talks can take months to wrap up, with no guarantee that both sides will reach an agreement.
Amazon, however, may find a receptive ear in EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager compared to Alphabet unit Google, which tried, but failed, to settle with her.
Vestager, who has taken a tough line with Apple and Facebook as well, has cited Amazon’s willingness in 2017 to offer concessions to settle an investigation into its distribution deals with e-book publishers in Europe, which she subsequently accepted.

This week Amazon lost a European Union court bid to prevent the bloc’s antitrust arm and Italy running parallel investigations into concerns over how the e-commerce giant treats sellers on its platform, reported Bloomberg.
Amazon’s challenge to a decision that allowed an Italian probe to continue alongside the European Commission’s own case was inadmissible, the EU General Court in Luxembourg said in an order published on its website.
Amazon had asked the court in January to annul part of the commission decision last year to open a probe into the “buy box,” where Amazon highlights sellers of a particular product. Amazon said the EU should not have added a carve-out allowing a similar Italian probe to run on. Related: Italy Probes Amazon, eBay Over Price Hikes Over CoronavirusThe EU investigation is checking how Amazon selects retailers for the highlighted buy box on pages that attract some 80% of sales. Officials will check how sellers can offer products to Amazon’s Prime loyalty program, which offers free delivery, and if that effectively favors Amazon’s own products and sellers that use Amazon’s logistics and delivery service.
Amazon said in an emailed statement that the company is “reviewing the court’s order and considering our next steps, including an appeal.”

On Monday gig workers at an Amazon warehouse in New York’s Staten Island filed a petition to form a union, Reuters reports. 
Chris Smalls, a former employee at the warehouse, led the effort to collect the 2,000 signatures needed to petition regulators for a vote to organize.
For the last 6 months, workers at the Staten Island warehouse called “JFK8” and other nearby Amazon facilities have been organizing to form an independent union called the Amazon Labor Union (ALU).
The workers, who also raised safety concerns at the start of the pandemic, are demanding higher wages, job security, safer working conditions, more paid time off and longer breaks.
According to Reuters, it is not clear when an election would be held if regulators green light the petition.
Amazon, the world’s biggest online retailer, beat back an effort by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) to organize its Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse.
Workers rejected joining the RWDSU by a more than 2-to-1 margin this spring, but another vote could be held as the NLRB reviews union claims that Amazon violated labor laws during the election.

A trade union for the services sector on Friday urged European authorities to widen their antitrust investigation of Amazon.com Inc to assess if the company engaged in creating knockoff goods and rigging search results on its platform.
The demand by the UNI Global Union was triggered by a Reuters report last week based on internal Amazon documents that showed the e-commerce company ran a systematic campaign of copying products and manipulating search results to boost its own private brands such as AmazonBasics in India, a key growth market.
In a letter dated Oct. 22 to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and also copied to EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, the union body’s European arm said authorities there must investigate if Amazon engaged in “similarly damaging behaviour within the European Union.”
“As further revelations of the scale of Amazon’s operations to undermine that level playing field surface, further action is needed to ensure it is held accountable at every turn,” the letter, seen by Reuters, said.

On Monday, October 18, members of US House Judiciary committee wrote to Amazon’s chief executive and accused the company’s top executives of misleading Congress about Amazon’s business practices, reported Reuters. 
This letter letter stated that the committee is considering “whether a referral of this matter to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation is appropriate.”
The letter addressed to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy following a Reuters investigation last week that showed that the company had conducted a systematic campaign of copying products and rigging search results in India to boost sales of its own brands – practices Amazon has denied engaging in. Jassy, a longtime Amazon executive, succeeded Bezos in July.
The letter states that “credible reporting” in the Reuters story and recent articles in several other news outlets “directly contradicts the sworn testimony and representations of Amazon’s top executives – including former CEO Jeffrey Bezos.”
“At best, this reporting confirms that Amazon’s representatives misled the Committee. At worst, it demonstrates that they may have lied to Congress in possible violation of federal criminal law,” the letter stated. Reuters reviewed a copy of the letter.
An Amazon spokesperson issued a statement that said “Amazon and its executives did not mislead the committee, and we have denied and sought to correct the record on the inaccurate media articles in question.”
They added, “As we have previously stated, we have an internal policy, which goes beyond that of any other retailer’s policy that we’re aware of, that prohibits the use of individual seller data to develop Amazon private label products. We investigate any allegations that this policy may have been violated and take appropriate action.”

Amazon took another major step toward the completion of Project Kuiper, its effort to provide internet access via satellite, by acquiring a team of more than a dozen Facebook employees based in Los Angeles in April to work on the initiative.
Amazon paid Facebook an undisclosed amount as part of the deal, which now has the employees working on delivering internet connectivity from “low Earth orbit satellites,” according to a report by The Information confirmed by a Facebook spokesperson.
The transaction means Facebook is scrapping its plans to deliver internet connectivity to remote areas using its own satellites, an effort that started in 2018 as a way “to bring broadband connectivity to rural regions where internet connectivity is lacking or nonexistent.” Facebook had also tried to use internet drones to bring connectivity to remote areas, but ended that effort in 2018.
Amazon first started exploring satellite-based internet connectivity in 2019, with plans that include a US$10 billion investment that will launch 3,236 satellites into a low-earth orbit by 2029. The goal is the same as the one Facebook just scrapped: internet for “unserved and underserved communities around the world.”
Amazon estimates that it will be able to provide internet connectivity to 95% of the world’s population through this initiative. About four billion people worldwide don’t currently have reliable internet access 
The FCC approved Amazon’s network plan last year, and the company plans to launch half of its satellites by 2026. The company is building a lab in Redmond, Washington, according to The Information, and about 500 Amazon employees are working on Project Kuiper.

Facebook sent a petition to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Wednesday, July 14, asking for Chair Lina Khan to be recused from the FTC’s antitrust case against the company, a step that could imperil the agency’s lawsuit against it.
According to the Wall Street Journal, the FTC sued Facebook in December, alleging that the social media giant broke antitrust law in buying photo-sharing site Instagram and messaging app WhatsApp. A US judge in June dismissed the complaint but gave the agency a roadmap for how to rewrite it and gave it a deadline of July 29 to refile it.
The company asked that Khan not be permitted to participate in deciding whether and how the FTC’s case against Facebook should proceed. Since the two current Republican commissioners voted to oppose the FTC lawsuit against Facebook in December, Khan’s recusal would leave two Democrats to vote for a new lawsuit. A tie vote means that the matter would not go forward.
“Chair Khan has consistently made well-documented statements about Facebook and antitrust matters that would lead any reasonable observer to conclude that she has prejudged the Facebook antitrust case brought by the FTC,” said a Facebook spokesperson in a statement.
“To protect the fairness and impartiality of these proceedings, we have requested that Chair Khan recuse herself from involvement with the FTC’s antitrust case against Facebook.”

The failure of a landmark anti-monopoly case against Facebook by the US Federal Trade Commission will not stop global regulators from waging an aggressive campaign against the social media giant over the next two years, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) chairman Rod Sims said.
Following last week’s court decision in Washington, which pushed Facebook’s market value above US$1 trillion, Mr Sims said Facebook and Google’s power was as big a problem as the millionaire Rockefeller family’s control of the global oil refining market a century ago, which was ultimately ruled an illegal monopoly by the US Supreme Court.
He said the ACCC was gathering evidence of market power abuses by the American companies and planned to use two current inquiries to launch a new assault on them in conjunction with counterparts in Europe, Britain, the US, and Canada.
“In the next six to 18 months, a lot will change in terms of how those abuses are dealt with,” Mr Sims said in an interview. “There is an extraordinary amount of market power: self preferencing, markets that aren’t transparent, very high charges and rent extraction.”

US tech giants Facebook, Alphabet’s Google, and Twitter have privately warned the Hong Kong government that they could stop offering their services in the city if authorities proceed with planned changes to data-protection laws, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, July 5, citing a letter.
The laws could make the tech companies liable for the malicious sharing of individuals’ information online, the newspaper added.
A letter sent by an industry group that includes the internet firms stated that the companies are concerned that the planned rules to address “doxing” could put their staff at risk of criminal investigations or prosecutions related to what the firms’ users post online, the Journal reported.
Hong Kong’s Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau in May proposed amendments to the city’s data-protection laws that it stated were needed to combat doxing, a practice that was prevalent during 2019 protests in the city, the newspaper reported.

A bipartisan group of US lawmakers expert in antitrust urged the Federal Trade Commission Friday to press on with its lawsuit against Facebook, according to a statement from Senator Amy Klobuchar.
In a letter to new FTC Chair Lina Khan, Klobuchar, Senator Mike Lee and Representatives David Cicilline and Ken Buck urged the FTC to “pursue enforcement action against Facebook and to consider all available options under the law for ensuring that the commission’s claims receive a full and fair hearing.”
Klobuchar and Cicilline, both Democrats, and Lee and Buck, both Republicans, hold the top positions on congressional antitrust panels.
The FTC is expected to file a new complaint against Facebook after US District Judge James Boasberg of District of Columbia dismissed one filed in December, experts said.
That complaint, which asked him to require Facebook to sell photo sharing app Instagram and messaging app WhatsApp, fell short, Boasberg said, because the FTC failed to show the company had monopoly power and instances of alleged anticompetitive behavior were too old.
Several veteran FTC officials said it was implausible that the agency did not have data to back up its assertion that Facebook had “in excess of 60%” of the social media market.
“What he told them was ‘I’m not going to read the newspaper and believe that Facebook is a monopoly’,” said Andy Gavil, an FTC veteran who teaches at the Howard University School of Law.

578,"June 30, 2021",Antitrust Ruling On Facebook’s Kustomer Buy Expected By August ,"


Facebook’s fate in terms of its acquisition of US customer service startup Kustomer will be decided by antitrust officials soon, US News reported.
The deal was intended to help scale up the social media company’s WhatsApp, which saw a new spate of usage in the pandemic. It was announced late in 2020.
But with antitrust concerns being paramount these days, EU antitrust regulators want to look more closely at deals with tech, pharma and biotech startups.
They’re looking out for warning signs of “killer acquisitions” in which big companies buy out rivals to squash competition — something Facebook has been accused of before. Austria had asked the EU to take over the review. Now, the Commission can either clear the deal or decide that a four-month investigation would be prudent.
Earlier this year, Facebook hit a market cap of US$1 trillion, with that making it the fifth company — following Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google parent Alphabet — to gain the distinction.
The revenue for Facebook is almost entirely the result of personal ads that Facebook users see when scrolling the popular social media site, along with companies it owns like Instagram.
The company has some new ideas in the pipeline, including a video-calling device and new virtual reality headsets from Oculus, with smart glasses slated to be released later in 2021.

579,"June 28, 2021",Judge Dismisses FTC’s Antitrust Lawsuit Against Facebook,"


A federal judge tossed out the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) antitrust lawsuit against Facebook, concluding that the government failed to establish that the tech platform had a monopoly on social media networks, reported The New York Times.
The judge, James E. Boasberg, still left open the possibility that the government could revive the case by amending its complaint. But he wrote that the government’s case was “legally insufficient and must therefore be dismissed.”
The decision is a setback to the FTC’s efforts to rein in the power of the platforms. In its lawsuit, it had sought to break up Facebook, citing its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp.
In the decision Boasberg wrote that the FTC failed to back up its claim that Facebook had a dominant share of the market in excess of 60%. He wrote that the government’s “inability to offer any indication of the metric(s) or method(s) it used to calculate Facebook’s market share renders its vague ‘60%-plus’ assertion too speculative and conclusory to go forward.”
He also found fault in the way that the government claimed that Facebook violated antitrust law by refusing interoperability permissions with competing apps. He wrote that “all such revocations of access occurred in 2013, seven years before this suit was filed, and the FTC lacks statutory authority to seek an injunction ‘based on [such] long-past conduct.’”
He said that the FTC was on “firmer ground” in challenging the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, rejecting Facebook’s claim that the FTC lacks authority to force Facebook to divest those purchases.
“Whether other issues arise in a subsequent phase of litigation is dependent on how the government wishes to proceed,” Boasberg wrote.
The judge also dismissed a case brought by 48 state attorneys general, in which they made similar claims. Unlike the federal government, he wrote, the states are bound by the doctrine of laches, in which those who “sleep on their rights” and wait too long to file a case cannot seek court relief. He noted that Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, yet the states’ case was filed last December. He also rejected the state’s claims on Facebook’s refusal to allow interoperability with competing apps.

580,"November 23, 2021",Italian Antitrust Watchdog Fines Apple & Amazon,"


Italy’s antitrust authority has fined US tech giants Amazon and Apple a total of more than 200 million euros ($225 million) for alleged anti-competitive cooperation in the sale of Apple and Beats products, reportes Reuters.
Contractual provisions of a 2018 agreement between the companies meant only selected resellers were allowed to sell Apple and Beats products on Amazon.it, the watchdog said, adding that this was in violation of European Union rules and affected competition on prices.
Both Apple and Amazon told Reuters they plan to appeal against the fines.
The authority imposed a fine of 68.7 million euros on Amazon and 134.5 million euros on Apple, ordering the companies to end the restrictions to give retailers of genuine Apple and Beats products access to Amazon.it in a non-discriminatory manner.
“To ensure our customers purchase genuine products, we work closely with our reseller partners and have dedicated teams of experts around the world who work with law enforcement, customs and merchants to ensure only genuine Apple products are being sold,” Apple said, denying any wrongdoing.
In a separate statement Amazon said it strongly disagreed with the decision of the Italian authority and that the proposed fine was “disproportionate and unjustified”.

581,"November 17, 2021",Apple To Allow iPhone Users To Repair Their Own Devices,"


Apple plans to give customers the ability to repair their own devices amid growing pressure from regulators and consumers around the world for manufacturers to ease restrictions on fixing products, reported The Wall Street Journal. 
The company on Wednesday announced a new program that will make spare parts for Apple products available to purchase starting early next year. 
The program, known as Self Service Repair, will let users fix broken devices using repair manuals that Apple will post on its website. 
Apple plans to start with some components that tend to require replacement such as displays, batteries and camera modules. 
The company says it will have more than 200 parts and tools available at launch and plans for more to be added later next year. The repair program will initially be available only for iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 users, but will later expand to Mac computers that use Apple’s new in-house M1 chip.

582,"November 15, 2021",Qualcomm To Keep Growing Without Apple,"


Investors once believed that Qualcomm”s fortunes rose and fell with Apple, which uses a key “modem” chip from the San Diego company to connect to mobile data networks, reported Reuters.
But as Qualcomm prepares for an investor presentation on Tuesday where it will outline plans to land its chips in everything from virtual reality headsets to self-driving cars to telecommunications gear, analysts said a looming loss of Apple, which is working on its own chips to replace Qualcomm’s, might not matter much to Qualcomm’s profits.
“Frankly, revenues are getting to the point where the worry over Apple possibly moving away is much smaller,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Ragson wrote in a note.
The change comes from a diversification strategy put in place years ago by Cristiano Amon, who ran the company’s chip division before becoming chief executive this year.
Earlier this month, Qualcomm said it expects adjusted earnings growth of more than 20% for fiscal 2022, where Wall Street had only been expecting growth of 12.5%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Shares of the company have risen almost 19% since Qualcomm gave its forecast.
“Anything beyond our contract with (Apple) is an upside to our model,” Amon said during an earnings call Nov. 3. “They have a large number of devices. And if there are opportunities, we’ll be very happy to engage with them on supply.”

583,"November 10, 2021",Apple’s Request For Pause Of ‘Fortnite’ Antitrust Suit Denied,"


On Tuesday a judge denied Apple’s efforts to pause orders handed down after an antitrust case brought by “Fortnite” creator Epic Games, reported Reuters. 
Apple immediately said it would appeal the denial, aiming to stave off potentially significant changes to its lucrative App Store before a Dec. 9 deadline to implement the court’s orders.
Epic went to trial earlier this year over Apple’s practice of forcing developers to use its in-app payment system and to pay commissions to the iPhone maker. In September, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers issued a ruling that was mostly favorable to Apple.
Related: Epic Games Sues Apple & Google In UK
But she expressed concern that Apple was keeping consumers in the dark about alternative payment methods and ordered Apple to lift its ban on in-app links, buttons and messages to users about other ways to pay.
Apple has appealed the judge’s ruling, asking her to pause her orders while the appeals process plays out, which could take several years.
In a sharp rebuke to the iPhone maker, Gonzalez Rogers said that Apple’s prohibitions on telling consumers about other payment methods showed “incipient antitrust conduct including super-competitive commission rates resulting in extraordinarily high operating margins” for its App Store.
She wrote that Apple’s own in-app payment methods would still be more convenient than third-party methods and that many consumers might still choose to use it.
“The fact remains: it should be their choice,” Gonzalez Rogers wrote. “Consumer information, transparency, and consumer choice is in the interest of the public.” Apple said it will appeal Gonzalez Rogers’ denial to the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which could grant Apple a temporary stay before the Dec. 9 deadline.

Apple software boss Craig Federighi took the stage at the Web Summit in Lisbon to voice the iPhone maker’s objections to EU draft guidelines that could allow customers to install software from outside its App Store, reported Reuters. 
Apple contends that such a move would make phones the target of malware or hijacking by cybercriminals and the company is sending top executives to Europe to garner public support and show its resolve in stopping the proposal becoming law.
The Digital Markets Act under consideration in Brussels would force phone makers to allow third-party software to be installed on their devices from outside official app stores.
Big Tech critics say Apple and others use their control over software to entrench their dominant positions, while Apple argues its policies are a matter of keeping users safe.
Apple calls such unofficial app installations “side-loading”. Such a function is already available on Android phones that make up a majority of devices around the world. Apple warned of malicious apps infecting shopper gadgets and made doomsday predictions.
“Sideloading is a cybercriminal’s best friend,” Federighi pressed the case on stage, addressing thousands of attendees at Europe’s largest technology conference.

Apple ‘s lawyers at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher have asked a California federal judge to toss a subpoena for live testimony from a company executive at a hearing this week in an antitrust lawsuit against the tech giant over a coronavirus-related app.
According to Reuters, Gibson Dunn partner Mark Perry, a lead lawyer for Apple, said on Monday in a filing in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California that the plaintiffs’ subpoena and notices to appear “are legally improper, unduly burdensome, and in contravention of this district’s local rules.”
US District Judge Edward Chen is scheduled on Thursday to hear Apple’s effort to dismiss the lawsuit, which alleges an antitrust violation tied to the company’s refusal to allow in the App Store a coronavirus-tracking app that was not affiliated with a government, hospital or university.
Chen will also hear plaintiff Coronavirus Reporter app’s push for a preliminary injunction. In court papers, the plaintiffs said they want Apple’s senior vice president of services Eddy Cue to testify at the motions hearing. The plaintiffs’ lawyers are probing Apple’s decision in March 2020 to deny the Coronavirus Reporter app.
Apple said in its motion to dismiss in August that the company “does not now, and did not then, have any obligation to approve and distribute on its own platform apps that are inconsistent with its guidelines or policies.”

On Friday, Apple outlined its objections to allowing app developers to link to third-party payment options ahead of a hearing next month that could determine whether a set of antitrust court orders is put on pause, reported Reuters. 
After a lengthy trial earlier this year brought by “Fortnite” creator Epic Games, US District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers issued a ruling that was largely favorable to the iPhone maker and upheld its practice of requiring developers to use its in-app payment system, for which it charges commissions.
But Gonzalez Rogers expressed concern that consumers did not have access to information about other ways to pay for apps. She ordered Apple to stop its ban on “buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms” beyond Apple’s own payment systems.
Related: Epic Games v. Apple: A Case Summary
Apple has until Dec. 9 to implement the order, but the company has appealed the ruling and asked the order to be put on hold while the appeal plays out, which could take a year or more. A hearing on the request is set for Nov. 9.
Apple on Friday for the first time signaled that its strongest objections are to the requirements to allow buttons and links that provide a “mechanism” for outside payments. The filing provided the first suggestion that Apple objects less strongly to allowing developers to provide information about other ways to pay.

The US tech giant could face a fine based on its revenue in Russia if found guilty of a breach, the regulator said. It did not indicate the size of any potential fine.
The company was earlier issued with a warning over the issue and given a Sept. 30 deadline to “stop abuse on the market”, the Roskomnadzor regulator said in a statement.

Another adds a new guideline saying that apps may request basic contact information with some restrictions.
The changes come in response to a class-action lawsuit from developers that Apple settled in August, the report stated. At that time, Apple promised to make changes such as these to the App Store.

A new report from The Information says that Apple is “very likely” to face an antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice in the United States. The report explains that the US DOJ has “accelerated” the antitrust probe into Apple, which it first opened back in 2019.
Citing people familiar with the matter, the report says that there has been a “flurry of activity on the investigation” since the summer. This includes a new rounds of subpoenas being sent to Apple’s business partners, additional DOJ staff being assigned to the probe, and more.
The DOJ probe is said to focus on a wide array of issues, with the broad focus being on Apple’s power as a technology market leader. Specific concerns raised in the report include App Tracking Transparency, Sign in with Apple, and the App Store. The DOJ is also looking into “complaints about how Apple places restrictions on location tracking that its own apps don’t have to follow.”
Finally, the report points out that Jonathan Kanter, the incoming head of the DOJ’s antitrust division, has previously represented opponents of Apple, including Spotify, Tile, Match, and Basecamp.

Smith didn’t name Apple directly, but said that some stores were crafting very high barriers and “increasingly say there is only one way to get on to our platform and that is to go through the gate that we ourselves have created.”
“In some cases they create a very high price per toll — in some cases 30% of your revenue has to go to the toll keeper,” he said, speaking at a Politico event Thursday (June 18), according to Bloomberg.
Smith claims some stores are operating in far more flagrant violation of antitrust regulations than Microsoft itself had when it was found guilty of disadvantaging sellers more than 20 years ago.

Slack is partnering with Amazon in a multiyear agreement that means all Amazon employees will be able to start using Slack. The deal comes just as Slack faces increased competition from Microsoft Teams, and it will also see Slack migrate its voice and video calling features over to Amazon’s Chimeplatform alongside a broader adoption of Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Amazon’s roll out of Slack to all of its employees is a big part of the deal, thanks to an enterprise-wide agreement. It’s not immediately clear how many of Amazon’s 840,000 employees will be using Slack, though. Up until today, Slack’s biggest customer has been IBM, which is rolling out Slack to its 350,000 employees.
While Slack has long used AWS to power parts of its chat app, it’s now committing to using Amazon’s cloud services as its preferred partner for storage, compute, database, security, analytics, machine learning, and future collaboration features. The deal means it’s unlikely we’ll see Slack turn to Microsoft’s Azure cloud services or Google Cloud to power parts of its service in the foreseeable future.

592,"February 11, 2020","The FTC Demands Info On Past Deals From Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google & Microsoft","


The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is demanding information from Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft on their mergers over the past nine years, significantly increasing the pressure on the tech industry’s biggest players amid growing antitrust scrutiny, reported The Wall Street Journal. 
The agency announced on Tuesday, February 11, that it issued the investigative subpoenas to the companies, seeking details on deals that fall below the threshold of normal federal antitrust reviews, as part of a study into acquisitions of startups.
The FTC has been particularly focused on re-examining mergers that already have been approved by the government. That re-examination could eventually lead the FTC to try to unwind deals that it finds to be having anticompetitive effects now, officials have said.
According to the Journal, the FTC action reflects growing concern in Washington and around the country that some US tech companies have grown so large and powerful that they have begun to squelch competition in various ways and harm consumers.
In a joint statement, the two Democrats on the five-member panel urged the Commission to study “consumer protection issues arising from the privacy and data security practices of technology companies, including social media platforms.”
“In particular, we encourage the FTC to study whether and, if so, how content curation and targeted advertising practices impact data collection, use, and sharing,” said the statement from Commissioners Christine S. Wilson and Rohit Chopra.

593,"January 21, 2020","How to lose a monopoly: Microsoft, IBM and antitrust","
By Benedict Evans
When Steve Wozniak created the original Apple I in 1975, IBM dominated the computing industry. It was nicknamed ‘Big Blue’, it was so far ahead of its competitors that people talked about ‘IBM and the seven dwarves’, and it had just come through yet another anti-trust case. IBM’s dominance, of course, was based on the mainframe, which was the central paradigm of the computing industry, and it had sealed its dominance just a decade earlier with the launch of the 360 system. However, over the next decade it became obvious that the flood of PCs that followed the Apple 1 were going to overtake the mainframe. All of the focus of innovation, investment and company creation moved to the PC. Indeed, PCs created the very idea that software could be a separate industry, and not just something that was bundled with your hardware. Microsoft, not IBM, dominated the PC ecosystem, and so Microsoft became the centre of the tech industry – it became the new sun in the solar system. 
The funny thing is, though, that mainframes didn’t go away. IBM went through a near-death experience in the 1990s, but mainframes carried on being used for mainframe things and IBM remained a big tech company. In fact, IBM’s mainframe installed base (measured in MIPS) has grown to be over ten times larger since 2000. Most people working in Silicon Valley today weren’t even born when mainframes were the centre of the tech industry, but they’re still there, inside the same big companies, doing the same big company things. (This isn’t just about IBM either – the UK’s sales tax system runs on DEC’s VAX. Old tech has a long half-life). Mainframes carried on being a good business a long time after IBM stopped being ‘Big Blue’.  
Much the same thing then happened to Microsoft. 20 years after the Apple 1, Microsoft launched Windows 95, which sealed its dominance of the PC industry, but Netscape had launched a year earlier, and Netscape and the web ended Microsoft’s dominance just as the PC had ended IBM’s dominance – the focus of innovation, investment and company creation moved elsewhere. Instead of creating software and companies around Windows APIs, the industry moved to creating software and companies around the internet and, especially, around the web. Microsoft never had dominance in the web, though it tried, just as IBM never had dominance in PCs, though it tried. And so in the 1970s, people worried about what IBM might do, and in the 1990s people worried about with Microsoft might do, but today, very few people in tech worry about what Microsoft might do – they worry about Google or Apple or Facebook or Amazon. Microsoft (or even IBM) might be a competitor, but they no longer have that dominance. Indeed, if you talk to senior Microsoft execs about this, they will say that for 20 years everything in tech was a PC accessory, but now the PC is just a smartphone accessory.

594,"January 20, 2020","US: Microsoft, IBM and Google granted access to medical records","
Hospitals have granted Microsoft, International Business Machines, and Amazon the ability to access identifiable patient information under deals to crunch millions of health records, reported the Wall Street Journal. 
This breadth of access wasn’t always spelled out by hospitals and tech giants when the deals were struck.
The scope of data sharing in these and other recently reported agreements reveals a powerful new role that hospitals play—as brokers to technology companies racing into the US$3 trillion health-care sector. Rapid digitization of health records in recent years and privacy laws enabling companies to swap patient data have positioned hospitals as a primary arbiter of how such sensitive data is shared. 
“Hospitals are massive containers of patient data,” said Lisa Bari, a consultant and former lead for health information technology for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Innovation Center. 
Hospitals can share patient data as long as they follow federal privacy laws, which contain limited consumer protections, she said. “The data belongs to whoever has it.”
Microsoft and Providence, a Renton, Washington, hospital system with data for about 20 million patient visits a year, are developing cancer algorithms by using doctor’s notes in patient medical records. The notes haven’t been stripped of personally identifiable information, according to Providence. 
And an agreement between IBM and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston, to jointly develop artificial intelligence allows the hospital to share personally identifiable data for specific requests, people involved in the agreement said—though so far the hospital hasn’t done so and has no current plans to do so, according to hospital and IBM officials. 
Microsoft executive Peter Lee in July described how his company would use Providence patient data without identifying information for algorithm development. In a December statement, he said patients’ personal health data remains in Providence’s control and declined to comment further.

Apple, Microsoft and BMW, together with a broad group of other tech companies and carmakers, have called on the EU to take action against so-called patent trolls, who buy up patents in the hope of making a profit through licenses or lawsuits. 
In a letter to the European Commission, the group of 35 companies and four industry groups warned that patent trolls were stifling innovation. 
They called for Thierry Breton, the new commissioner who oversees industrial policy and technology, to draw up tough rules to stop patent hoarders from “gaming the system”.
In particular, they asked for EU courts to take a softer approach, noting that in the past judges have issued blanket bans on products when just a single patent was found to be infringed. 
“The experience of our member companies indicates that Europe’s patent system is not working properly and is undermining Europe’s ability to compete globally in the next frontier of technologies,” said Patrick Oliver, executive director of IP2Innovate, one of the industry groups that signed the letter.
“We are urging Commissioner (Thierry) Breton to draft a set of guidelines that address imbalances in the patent system — in particular guidelines that support the application of a proportionality requirement in patent enforcement by judges around Europe, as required by EU law,” the companies said.

By Eric Newcomer, Bloomberg
Hi all, it’s Eric. Two decades ago, Microsoft Corp. fended off the U.S. government’s best effort to break the company into pieces. But even as it kept regulators from cleaving it apart, Microsoft seemed to fall into something of an antitrust-induced stupor. According to one popular theory, the company’s executives became overly worried about what their counterparts in legal might say, slowing innovation. 
Today’s technology giants are staring down their own antitrust dilemma and seem resolved not to get too fussed about it. Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are venturing into all sorts of industries even as the regulars are bearing down. It’s almost like they’ve studied Microsoft’s regulator-abetted lethargy and are making sure to avoid it.
Google recently announced it would pay $2.1 billion to buy Fitbit, the wearable device maker, and is also building a search engine for a hospital network, scooping up healthcare data on “millions of people across 21 states” in the process. (Google says there’s nothing nefarious about the effort, dubbed “Project Nightingale.”) It’d like to be your banker, too. This week, the Wall Street Journal revealed Google’s plans to create checking accounts in a partnership with Citigroup Inc.

597,"November 12, 2019",US: Microsoft says it will follow California’s digital privacy law,"
Microsoft stated in a blog post on Monday, November 11, that it would honor California’s privacy law throughout the United States, expanding the impact of a strict set of rules meant to protect consumers and their data.
Microsoft wrote in the post it was a “strong supporter” of the California Consumer Privacy Act, known as CCPA, which will go into effect on January 1. 
The California law is widely expected to harm profits over the long term for technology companies, retailers, advertising firms, and other businesses dependent on collecting consumer data to track users and increase sales. 
The law raised fears among companies of a rise in a patchwork of state laws and prompted efforts in Washington to write federal legislation that would preempt state efforts. 
“Under CCPA, companies must be transparent about data collection and use, and provide people with the option to prevent their personal information from being sold. Exactly what will be required under CCPA to accomplish these goals is still developing,” Julie Brill, Microsoft’s chief privacy officer, wrote in the post.

600,"April 6, 2022",New Suit Accuses Google Of Stifling Voice Recognition Competitors,"


Search engine behemoth Google was hit with federal antitrust litigation in DC, over claims the tech giant leverages its market dominance to block most major electronic devices from simultaneously running multiple apps that use different voice assistant “wakewords,” reported Bloomberg.
The lawsuit accuses the company of erecting “artificial” barriers—through its Android operating system, pacts with manufacturers, and a side deal with Apple—restricting “concurrent wakeword” technology that could lead consumers to search engines other than Google.
Google has told device makers that it won’t allow them to run the company’s Google Assistant if they simultaneously offer access to competing voice assistants. For Sonos, this means that its customers have to choose between making Amazon’s Alexa or the Google Assistant the default voice assistant for its microphone-equipped smart speakers.
 Sonos has developed technology that allows the concurrent use of multiple voice assistants, effectively leaving it to end users to choose whether they call on Alexa or the Google Assistant to handle certain tasks. That way, someone could ask Google for the weather, and then tell Alexa to add something to their Amazon shopping list, simply by using different wake words.
In January 2020, Sonos sued tech giant Google for allegedly copying its wireless speaker design, urging the International Trade Commission (ITC) to ban Google products like laptops, phones and speakers.
It’s worth noting that not all tech companies are as protective of their voice assistants as Google. Amazon in particular has been a proponent of a more open approach; the company founded the Voice Interoperability Initiative to promote solutions similar to that developed by Sonos.

601,"April 6, 2022",South Korean Regulator Concerned Over Google’s Latest App Store Payment Policy,"


Last year, South Korea became the first country to approve legislation changing Google and Apple Inc.’s policies on how apps on their platforms sell subscriptions, in-game items, and other online content. 
The law forbids Google and Apple from forcing apps to use their own in-app payment systems, giving developers more options and potentially avoiding service fees of up to 30%. The law governing app stores went into effect in September of last year. 
However, the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) did not issue definitive enforcement instructions until March. Google and Apple are still working on a regulatory compliance strategy to satisfy the Korean authorities. 
Google had recently attempted to prohibit app developers from giving an in-app link to an external website to purchase digital goods. This practice is known as “outlinking,” and it avoids Google’s fees. According to Google, those that provided external links would be unable to update their apps starting this month, and their apps may be removed from the Google Play Store by June 1. 
However, the KCC released legal guidance stating that Google’s actions would violate South Korea’s app payment law by forcing apps to utilize a single payment method and making it difficult to provide alternative options. 
In South Korea, Google and its Android operating system have a substantial market share. According to Counterpoint Research, a digital industry research organization, Samsung Electronics Co., the hometown brand that runs Android, controls 72 percent of the local smartphone market, compared to Apple’s 21 percent. 
According to Google, the company is studying the KCC guidance and will look for ways to continue investing in the Android ecosystem while working with local app developers to improve customer choice. The tech company previously stated that it would continue to charge 4 percentage points lower costs on in-app payments handled via third-party payment providers to help them with the additional costs that developers incur to support their billing systems. 
According to Google, the commission may be as low as 6% for eBook providers when users choose alternative systems, instead of 10% using Google’s Billing system, and as high as 26% for popular mobile game apps. 
Nevertheless, according to the Wall Street Journal, Apple, which charges a 30% fee for in-app purchases around the world, has yet to implement policy modifications compliant with South Korean legislation. According to the KCC, Apple has expressed a desire to cooperate. Apple has yet to respond to the KCC’s new legal instructions.

602,"April 3, 2022",Indian Suit Claims Google Unfairly Blocked Rival Payments,"


The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Friday released early findings of an investigation into Google’s app store and its payment system, Google Pay. As Bloomberg reported, it found that Google’s Play Store billing system for app developers is “unfair and discriminatory”. 
Back in 2020, Google decided to delay enforcing its 30% commission for app developers in India following an outcry from the country’s startup community. The tech giant agreed to defer the policy until this month. 
But in the interim, Indian developers lobbied the nation’s government to stop Google from enacting what they felt was an unfairly high fee. 
Developers also believed that Android phones, which are preloaded with the Play Store, give Google an unfair advantage over rival payment systems that have found it hard to find a footing in the digital ecosystem dominated by big players.Of particular concern in India is whether Google Pay will undercut rival United Payments Interface (or UPI) apps, which allow users to directly debit payments from their bank accounts using just a virtual address. UPI payment apps like Google Pay, PhonePe and Paytm are currently the most popular way for Indians to make payments online. 
Critics have alleged that Google’s control of the Play Store and the Android operating system gives it an unfair amount of control over India’s digital payment ecosystem. A two-year probe concluded last year by the Competition Commission of India found that Google had abused the dominant position of its Android operating system, using its “huge financial muscle” to illegally hurt competitors.India’s antitrust regulator echoed similar concerns over Google Pay. “Google’s conduct is also resulting in a denial of market access to competing UPI apps since the market for UPI enabled digital payment apps is multi-sided, and the network effects will lead to a situation where Google Pay’s competitors will be completely excluded from the market in the long run,” wrote CCI in documents viewed by Bloomberg.

603,"March 30, 2022",DOJ Turns Up The Heat On Google Maps Probe,"
The US Justice Department (DOJ) has honed in on its investigation of Google Maps to determine if bundling the service together with other Google software illegally stifles competition, reported Reuters. 
The probe of the Alphabet unit first came to light in late 2020 and had been quiet until recent months when investigators again began making inquiries, the sources said.
Google said it cooperates with regulators and welcomes their questions. The Justice Department declined to comment.
The probe has two components. One part focuses on apps, including for navigation, that are provided through infotainment screens in vehicles. In its Google Automotive Services package for automakers, the search company bundles together Maps, the Google Play app store, Google Assistant and other services. Car companies are prevented from, for example, mixing Google Maps with voice assistants developed by smaller rivals, one source said.
In response, Google said the integration provides the best user experience, and that in some instances a rival voice assistant can function with Google Maps.
The other component focuses on app and website developers. Specifically, the department is looking at Google’s requirement that if a website or app uses one Google technology, say Google’s location search, the website or app developer cannot use maps or other technologies developed by Google’s rivals, the two sources said.

604,"March 29, 2022",French Watchdog Fines Google Over App Store Practices,"


A French court has fined Google $2.2 million (€2 million) for what the country’s government has described as “abusive” dealings with developers on its app store.
As Bloomberg reported Tuesday (March 29), the Paris Commercial Court has also ruled Google must also update seven clauses from its contracts that included a 30% commission on revenues generated by developers on Google’s Play store.
The case stems from 2018, when Google and Apple made price and contract changes on developers selling software in their stores and the French Ministry of Finance decided to take action against the tech giants.
“I will therefore be taking Google and Apple to the Paris commercial court for abusive trade practices,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said then. “As powerful as they are, Google and Apple should not be able to treat our startups and our developers the way they currently do.”
A spokesperson for Google told Bloomberg the company was disappointed in the ruling, but said it was too early to determine whether Google will appeal.
“We are always looking to provide more support for developers and help them build sustainable businesses, including recently decreasing our service fees to 15% or less for 99% of developers,” the spokesperson said.
The case against Apple is still pending, although the iPhone maker has been dealing with its own headaches in Europe over its handling of its app store.

605,"March 27, 2022","Google In Indian Authority’s Crosshairs, Again","


The Competition Commission of India, the country’s chief competition regulator, has ordered an investigation into the “abuse of dominance” by tech giant Google, the Indian Newspaper Society has said in a statement. The outfit, representing various Indian journalism enterprises, has promoted the Commission’s actions.
The INS  sought fair value for content hosted on Google, stating that news publishers are not being properly compensated for the content they generate.
“The News Media Houses are completely kept in the dark on the total advertising revenue collected by Google and what actual percentage of the advertising revenue is being transferred to media organizations. The European Publishers Council had also filed a competition complaint against Google alleging that Google has achieved end to end control of the ad tech value chain, thus abusing its dominant position,” the statement released on Friday said.
The society has also alleged that Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc, along with Google LLC, Google India Private Limited, Google Ireland Limited, and Google Asia Pacific Pvt Ltd are “abusing their dominant position related to News Referral Services and Google Ad Tech Services in the Indian online news media market, which is in violation of Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2002”.
The complaint echoes a case heard earlier this year by the CCI, where the Digital News Publishers Association, which comprises the digital arms of some of India’s biggest media companies, stated Google denied fair advertising revenue to its members.
News organizations, which have been losing advertising revenue to online aggregators such as Google, have complained for years about tech companies using stories in search results or other features without payment.
Google has had previous run-ins with Indian competition authorities, including accusations over the company’s Android operating system, claiming the company was using its “huge financial muscle” to illegally hurt competitors,

Alphabet’s Google urged a judge hearing a US antitrust case against it to reject the Justice Department’s request that it be sanctioned, saying it had not abused attorney-client privilege, reported Reuters. 
The department had asked Judge Amit Mehta to sanction Google, saying the company’s “Communicate with Care” program was sometimes a “game” to shield communications that did not genuinely fall under attorney-client privilege.
In a filing dated Thursday, Google said that “allegations of sanctionable misconduct are baseless” and a misreading of a small number of slides used to train employees.

Google also said it was conferring with the government on which emails that are indicated as potentially falling under attorney-client privilege genuinely do. It said it had given the government some of the affected documents.
“Plaintiffs come nowhere close to proving the bad-faith misconduct that is required to strip a party of its privilege protections,” Google said in its filing.
The Justice Department filed the lawsuit against Google in 2020, accusing it of violating antitrust law in its handling of its search business. Trial was set for September 2023.

607,"March 23, 2022",Google Play Allows Spotify To Use Third-Party Payments,"


Google and Spotify said on Wednesday that a future version of the Spotify app will allow users to sign up inside the app to pay Spotify directly for a subscription.
The move is the most significant concession so far from a major mobile app store to allow third-party billing systems inside apps, which has become a major focus for regulators around the world.
Shares of Spotify popped about 4.5% in after-hours trading on the news.
Historically, on Google Play, as well as Apple’s App Store, developers usually can’t solicit credit card numbers directly from their customers to bill them for digital goods or services. Instead, they have to bill users through Google’s system, which takes at least 15%, and as much as 30%, of total sales.
But there are caveats: Google’s announcement on Wednesday calls the move a “pilot” and doesn’t offer a timeline for wide implementation or specify which countries will first get the feature. The announcement suggested that only a “small number” of app makers will be allowed to offer their own billing, to start.
“This pilot will allow a small number of participating developers to offer an additional billing option next to Google Play’s billing system and is designed to help us explore ways to offer this choice to users, while maintaining our ability to invest in the ecosystem,” Google said in a blog post.
Spotify will still pay a fee to Google for payments it processes on its own, Google confirmed. Google said it would “build on” a policy that it introduced in South Korea where it continues to take an 11% fee on subscription purchases made through alternative billing, which became required by a recent law passed in the country.
The move also puts pressure on Apple, which is firmly against third-party billing on its iPhone App Store for digital goods, and argues that its App Store competes with Google Play, especially when it comes to app distribution terms and fees.

The class action was filed with the Competition and Anti-Competitive Practices Tribunal of the two companies, as announced in the filing.
In both lawsuits, Jus Omnibus asks the Santarém court to recognize a one-time and persistent violation of the rights of the two companies, which caused “damage to the scattered and / or collective interests of protecting the consumption of goods and services and competition”, condemning the two companies for anti-competitive practices and ordering compensation “to all those affected Portuguese consumers.

The problem is that Google enters into “anti-competitive contracts with Android hardware manufacturers and app developers culminating in a 30% commission on each sale,” the value of which “passed on to consumers.”

Google employees have been improperly using attorney-client privilege to shield documents from discovery in litigation and government investigations, the Justice Department says in a court filing.
In a court filing, the Justice Department asked for Google to be sanctioned for creating a Communicate-with-Care program that trains workers to include an attorney and a request for advice when writing about sensitive business matters. 
Often, knowing the game, the in-house counsel included in these Communicate-with-Care emails does not respond at all, the department said, adding that many of the emails had to do with revenue share agreements that Google had struck with other companies.
A Google spokesperson said that the company had given the government more than 4 million documents. “Our teams have conscientiously worked for years to respond to inquiries and litigation, and suggestions to the contrary are flatly wrong” the spokesperson said.
The allegations are the latest in a series of challenges against Google and other Tech Giants.

610,"October 17, 2021","Klobuchar, Grassley To Introduce Antitrust Bill Aiding Amazon Sellers","


Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, said she will soon introduce a major antitrust bill aimed at Big Tech alongside Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, reported CNBC. 
The American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which shares a name and broad features with a bill introduced by House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., would prohibit dominant online platforms from engaging in discriminatory behavior. That could include wielding their gatekeeper power to disadvantage rivals or to preference their own products over others.
Cicilline’s version of the bill was voted out of the House Judiciary Committee this summer.
The bill would have profound implications for companies like Amazon, Apple and Google which all run their own marketplaces for products or information. Those companies have been accused of ranking their own products higher than rivals’ in an attempt to generate more profits for themselves.
Third-party sellers on Amazon, for example, have suspected the platform ranks its own similar private-label products over their own. Travel or local search sites like Yelp and Tripadvisor have complained that Google unfairly lowers their links in search results in favor of prime placement of its Google Maps tool. The platforms have denied any misconduct and say their decisions are based on determinations about what will make up the best experience for users.
“Congress and tech companies have plenty of work to do to make the Internet better, safer, and healthier — but instead of doing that, this bill takes a hammer to tech products that consumers love,” wrote Adam Kovacevich, CEO of Chamber of Progress, a center-left group backed by Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, among others. “Preventing Amazon from selling Amazon Basics and banning Google’s maps from its search results isn’t going to do anything to make the Internet better for families.”
Klobuchar said in a statement that the bill would grant more choice to consumers.
“As Big Tech has grown and evolved over the years, our laws have not changed to keep up and ensure these companies are competing fairly,” Grassley said in a statement. “Big Tech needs to be held accountable if they behave in a discriminatory manner. Our bill will help create a more even playing field and ensure that small businesses are able to compete with these platforms.”

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on Tuesday, October 5, advised lawmakers not to get too “emotional” while pursuing antitrust cases against his company, reported CNBC.
Jassy, who became Amazon’s CEO in July, was asked at the GeekWire Summit about the antitrust lawsuit filed in May by Washington, DC’s attorney general, Karl A. Racine. That complaint alleges that Amazon locks third-party merchants into agreements where they can’t offer goods any cheaper elsewhere online.
“It’s really important for Congress or lawmakers to really be thoughtful about what they’re trying to accomplish and not emotional,” Jassy said. The retail sector is highly competitive, he added, referring to his earlier comment that Amazon has only 1% of this global market and that physical stores represent 85% of the industry, reported Business Insider.
“It’s pretty hard to make retail more competitive,” he said. “If you’re making legislation, you want to make sure it applies to the whole industry and not one company.”
Jassy rejected the idea that Amazon’s online marketplace is so dominant that sellers have to use it. He also repeatedly said lawmakers might create “negative unintended consequences” with antitrust regulation.

612,"September 13, 2021",DC Attorney General Goes After Amazon’s Wholesale Biz In Antitrust Suit,"


Washington, DC, attorney general Karl Racine expanded his antitrust complaint against Amazon on Monday, September 13, targeting the company’s relationships with wholesale suppliers.
Racine sued Amazon in May over allegations that the company illegally maintained monopoly power through its pricing contracts with third-party sellers.
The amended complaint expands Racine’s initial allegations to include what he claims are the anticompetitive effects of Amazon’s agreements with first-party sellers, also known as FPS or wholesalers. The original complaint focused on how Amazon’s contracts with third-party sellers (TPS), or those who sell on Amazon under their own brand names, allegedly stifle competition.
The Washington Post first reported the news of Racine’s amended complaint. Much of Amazon’s dominance in e-commerce has come from its third-party marketplace. That service is made up of millions of independent merchants who rely on Amazon’s logistics and fulfillment services to get their goods to customers’ doorsteps. Amazon also buys products wholesale from other companies, known as vendors or first-party sellers, and then handles the selling process.
In the new filing, Racine alleges that Amazon’s “Minimum Margin Agreement” with first-party sellers has the “practical effect” of incentivizing those wholesalers to raise their prices for marketplaces outside of Amazon.
That’s because those agreements require that the wholesaler guarantee Amazon a minimum profit, according to the complaint, meaning the seller must make up the difference if it doesn’t reach that margin. Racine alleges first-party sellers may be inclined to raise their prices elsewhere “to ensure that Amazon does not drop its price based on lower prices elsewhere.”
“These agreements reduce other online marketplaces’ ability to compete with Amazon by offering lower prices to consumers,” according to the complaint, which goes on to say that the practice “results in reduced competition among online marketplaces and higher prices to consumers.”

Amazon is in talks to acquire the rights of the National Football League’s (NFL) “Sunday Ticket” package and is seen as the frontrunner by others involved in talks with the league, CNBC reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The NFL is expected to ask for US$2 billion to US$2.5 billion per year for the package and wants to wrap up discussions before the season ends in February, two of the people said. “Sunday Ticket” has been owned by DirecTV for the past 27 years. Talks are progressing with interested parties, suggesting the league is getting closer to choosing a new provider, said the people.
The “Sunday Ticket” service allows NFL fans to watch a wide variety of football games outside of their local markets. The move would help boost Amazon’s live sports offerings on its streaming service.
FL Commissioner Roger Goodell told CNBC on Wednesday, September 8, the out-of-market Sunday game package “maybe will be more attractive on a digital platform” as streaming platforms continue to add subscribers at the expense of traditional pay-television. Goodell also suggested to CNBC that the league is looking for one strategic partner to acquire not only “Sunday Ticket” rights but to also invest in NFL Network, which airs NFL content all year, and NFL RedZone, which shows live footage of game action when teams are close to scoring touchdowns. The NFL currently owns both NFL Network and NFL RedZone.
Earlier in May, NFL stated it had moved up the date for Amazon’s Prime video to exclusively stream Thursday Night Football, beginning with the 2022 season.

614,"September 9, 2021",Amazon & Co Move To Dismiss Booksellers’ Antitrust Suit,"


In separate motions this week, Amazon and the Big Five publishers asked a federal court to dismiss the latest iteration of a potential class-action price-fixing claim filed against them on behalf of indie booksellers.
According to court filings, the booksellers’ Amended Complaint, which was filed in July, accuses Amazon and the publishers of illegal price discrimination under the Robinson-Patman Act. But in their motions to dismiss, both Amazon and the publishers insist there is no illegal agreement to fix or otherwise restrain prices, and that the amended complaint is legally deficient and must be tossed.
Related:  Booksellers Sue Amazon & Big Five Publishers For Price-Fixing
“The Complaint recites that Amazon is a leading book retailer, takes issue with ordinary price competition, and tries to illogically and conclusorily claim that Publisher Defendants conspired with each other and with Amazon to confer a monopoly on Amazon, despite Publisher Defendants resisting Amazon’s growing position in the market for decades,” read the publishers motion to dismiss. “This is simply not plausible. After realizing its originally pled Sherman Act conspiracy claims had no basis, Plaintiff tried to repackage them in its Complaint and bolster them with a price discrimination claim under the Robinson-Patman Act. The Complaint, however, is fatally deficient under either statute and must be dismissed.”
In its motion to dismiss, Amazon lawyers also insist that there is no conspiracy with the publishers, no evidence of illegal collusion, and that its bargaining for lower print book prices is simply good business—and good for consumers.
“Bargaining between buyers and sellers is one of the most commonplace, precompetitive actions that can occur in any market,” the Amazon brief stated. “As the Supreme Court has stressed repeatedly, it would do great damage to competition and consumers alike if the [Robinson-Patman Act] were misconstrued as having outlawed competitive bargaining.”
The suit was first filed in March, 2021, when Evanston, Ill.-based Indie bookseller Bookends & Beginnings teamed up with the law firm currently leading a sprawling class action price-fixing suit against Amazon and the Big Five publishers in the e-book market to file an antitrust lawsuit on behalf of a potential class of booksellers accusing Amazon and the Big Five publishers (Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Simon & Schuster, and Penguin Random House) of a conspiracy to restrain price competition in the retail and online print trade book market.

A coalition of advocacy groups is urging Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairwoman Lina Khan to have the agency block Amazon from acquiring MGM Studios to slow the retail giant’s “growing dominance”, reported the Information.
In May, Amazon announced that it had reached a US$8.45 billion deal to acquire MGM Studios, which produces popular franchises like the James Bond films. The FTC is reportedly investigating the proposed deal.
Shortly after the announcement, Amazon pushed for Khan—who has massive support from progressives and has been critical of big tech companies—to recuse herself from antitrust cases involving the retail giant.
Amazon claimed Khan, who wrote about Amazon and antitrust in a 2017 Yale Law Journal article, would not “be a neutral and impartial evaluator of the evidence developed in any antitrust investigation against Amazon.”
On Tuesday, August 31, the more than 30 advocacy groups—which include Demand Progress Education Fund, the Revolving Door Project, the Writers Guild of America West, the Working Families Party, MediaJustice, and others—wrote in a letter to Khan that the proposed MGM deal was “the latest move in Amazon’s overarching strategy to create numerous interconnected points of dominance over businesses and consumers.”
The letter noted that the deal could force consumers to subscribe to Amazon Prime because content would be exclusive to it, or that the retail giant could deny other streaming platforms access to its content. The letter also raises concerns over the “business and consumer data Amazon [would] acquire” in the proposed deal, which would “further entrench Amazon’s one-sided information advantage over other businesses that depend on its platform.”
“There is ample evidence already that Amazon uses the combined elements of its platform as a cudgel against its rivals,” the letter reads. “The proposed acquisition of MGM would give an already abusive monopoly even more weapons to use against consumers, businesses, and workers. We urge the FTC to halt this deal and to continue to investigate Amazon’s broad abuse of its ecosystem.”

India’s Future Retail on Saturday, August 28, filed a new case against Amazon at the Supreme Court in its latest effort to seek clearance for its US$3.4 billion retail assets sale, which the US firm has challenged.
The Supreme Court this month dealt a blow to Future when it said an interim decision by a Singapore arbitrator in October 2020 that put its deal with Reliance Industries on hold – following Amazon’s complaint – was valid in India.
The top court had also said Future could not appeal a lower court’s decision against it. The retailer is now asking the top court to hear the challenge, people familiar with the case said.
In its over 6,000-page filing, Future has argued that if the deal with Reliance doesn’t go through, it would cause “unimaginable” damage to the group, including possible job losses for 35,575 employees, and put at risk roughly 280 billion rupees (US$3.81 billion) in bank loans and debentures.

By signing up, sellers will also be given opportunities to communicate directly with elected officials about the bills, the website states.

Three US senators, including Democrat Amy Klobuchar who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, wrote a letter to Amazon to express concern about its palm print recognition system, Klobuchar’s office said Friday.
According to Reuters, Amazon began rolling out biometric technology at its Whole Foods stores around Seattle in April, letting shoppers pay for items with a scan of their palm. The system, called Amazon One, lets customers link a credit card to their palm print. 
Klobuchar, who was joined by Senators Bill Cassidy, a Republican, and Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, expressed concern in the letter dated Thursday about both privacy and competition related to Amazon One.
“Our concerns about user privacy are heightened by evidence that Amazon shared voice data with third-party contractors and allegations that Amazon has violated biometric privacy laws,” the lawmakers wrote in the letter.
“We are also concerned that Amazon may use data from Amazon One, including data from third-party customers that may purchase and use Amazon One devices, to further cement its competitive power and suppress competition across various markets,” they wrote.
The lawmakers asked Amazon about plans to expand Amazon One, and to whom they had sold or licensed the technology. They also asked how many people had signed up for it, how the data is used and if it is ever paired with facial recognition systems.

620,"June 27, 2021",Facebook Rejects Talks With Australia Publisher,"


Australia’s competition watchdog is looking into a claim that Facebook refused a publisher’s request to negotiate a licensing deal, according to The New York Post, setting the stage for the first test of the world’s toughest online content law.
The Conversation, which publishes current affairs commentary by academics, said it asked Facebook to begin talks as required under new Australian legislation that requires the social media firm and Alphabet’s Google to negotiate content-supply deals with media outlets.
Facebook declined without giving a reason, The Conversation said, even though the publisher was among the first in Australia to secure a similar deal with Google in the lead-up to the law in 2020.
The knockback could present the first test of a controversial mechanism unique to Australia’s effort to claw back advertising dollars from Google and Facebook: If they refuse to negotiate license fees with publishers, a government-appointed arbitrator may step in.
In a statement responding to Reuters’ questions, Facebook’s head of news partnerships for Australia, Andrew Hunter, said the company was “focused on concluding commercial deals with a range of Australian publishers.”
Hunter did not answer specific questions concerning The Conversation, but said Facebook was planning a separate initiative “to support regional, rural and digital Australian newsrooms and public-interest journalism in the coming months,” without giving details.

621,"June 20, 2021",Data Sharing between WhatsApp and Facebook: The CCI Opens an Investigation Against the Social Juggernauts,"

By Parumita Pal and Hrishav Kumar*
 
Introduction 
The switch from traditional brick-and-mortar business models to rapidly a evolving digital mode of doing business has impacted the way the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”) has been looking at cases involving data privacy and protection issues. The decisions by the CCI in the past few years indicate how the CCI has been slowly acclimatizing itself to these changing markets. Particularly with regard to competition cases involving WhatsApp as a party, the paradigm shift in the CCI’s decisional practice is evident.
  
Can the CCI Regulate Data Sharing and Privacy Concerns?
Earlier in June 2017 the CCI examined allegations of abuse of dominance against WhatsApp. It was alleged that WhatsApp’s privacy policy, updated in 2016, compels its users to share their data with Facebook. However, in dismissing the allegations the CCI observed that users were provided with the option to opt out of sharing user account information with Facebook within 30 days of the updated terms coming into operation. On the allegations of a breach of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (“IT Act”) and right to privacy, the CCI observed that violations of the IT Act do not fall within its purview.1
Interestingly, in August 2020, the CCI noted that Facebook and WhatsApp undeniably deal with sensitive data which is amenable to misuse (i.e., through targeted advertisement) and may raise potential antitrust concerns, among other data protection issues.  However, in absence of any concrete accusation or specific information, the case against WhatsApp was dismissed with respect to the allegation of misuse of consumer data.2
In June3 and November4 2020, while analyzing two combinations involving prominent players, the CCI noted that business combinations between entities having access to user data can be analyzed from the perspective of data-backed market power. Be that as it may, both combinations were approved by the CCI with a caveat that any anticompetitive conduct resulting from data sharing could be taken up under enforcement provisions (i.e., Section 3 and Section 4) of the Competition Act, 2002 (“Competition Act”).
Notably, the CCI in its E-commerce Report and Telecom Report had highlighted some data related issues that may raise competition concerns. The Market Study on E-commerce in India (“E-commerce report”) observed the intermediary role of the platform which allows it to collect and leverage competitively relevant data to enhance the quality of their platform and either introduce their own private label or boost its ‘preferred seller’.5
Recently, in March 2021 the CCI ordered a suo moto investigation against WhatsApp and Facebook (“WhatsApp Privacy Policy Case”). The CCI observed that WhatsApp through its updated privacy policy has made it mandatory for its users to accept the new terms and privacy policy including sharing their data with Facebook. Thereby, the CCI formed a prima facie opinion that the ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ nature of WhatsApp’s updated privacy policy and terms of service appear to be unfair for WhatsApp’s users, and accordingly ordered a detailed investigation. Notably, the CCI also observed that cross-linking and data integration can strengthen the data advantage, as well as safeguarding and reinforcing the market power of dominant firms. Further, for Facebook collecting data from WhatsApp can be a means to supplement the consumer profiling that Facebook engages in across a vast number of locations and devices outside the Facebook platform. Thus, the CCI observed that the impugned data sharing provision may have exclusionary effects in the display advertising market, which has the potential to undermine the competitive process and create entry barriers other than leveraging.6
  
Is the CCI Stepping Beyond Its Jurisdiction?
The WhatsApp Privacy Policy Case also dealt with issues challenging the jurisdiction of the CCI in matters concerning data. The case has surely raised certain doubts as to whether the CCI has jurisdiction to deal with data-related matters in the absence of any data regulator.
Interestingly, in its Market Study on the Telecom Sector in India (“Telecom Report”) the CCI observed that while overlapping jurisdictions between institutions cannot be eliminated, they ought to be harmonized through better regulatory design and improved lines of communication.7
The legislature had foreseen such issues and included inbuilt safeguards to deal with such issues. While Section 60 of the Competition Act contains a non-obstante clause and expressly provides that the provisions of the Competition Act will have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other law, Section 62 expressly provides that. The Competition Act would be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law.
Nevertheless, WhatsApp and Facebook challenged the order of the CCI before the Delhi High Court (“DHC”). WhatsApp argued that since the judicial challenge to its updated privacy policy is already pending before the Supreme Court and the DHC, it is not proper for the CCI to consider the same issues in exercise of its suo moto powers under the Competition Act. Earlier in the Bharti Airtel case, the Supreme Court deferred the jurisdiction of the CCI until the Telecom Regulator of India examines and decided upon the factual and technical matrix of the case. However, the DHC limited the application of the Bharti Airtel case and upheld the jurisdiction of the CCI to adjudicate upon competition concerns pertaining to data collection and usage. It further observed that it would have been prudent for the CCI to have awaited the outcome of the petitions before the Supreme Court and the DHC. However, pending petitions before other courts cannot oust the jurisdiction of the CCI.8
Presently, the matter is pendente lite in the DHC and awaits consideration by the division bench. Needless to say, the case would leave behind a historic precedent for similar disputes on the subject.
  
Global Trends: Antitrust Wave Against the Big Techs?
‘Data’ is the new ‘profit’ and the global trends indicate that the antitrust regulators worldwide are well aware of it. In Europe, the European Commission (“EC”) has proposed two legislative proposals: The Digital Services Act (“DSA”) and the Digital Markets Act (“DMA”), as part of the European Digital Strategy. While the DMA governs gatekeeper online platforms and targets lack of competition in the digital market, the DSA governs online intermediaries and is essentially concerned with transparency and consumer protection.9 Meanwhile, in the United States, the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law released an investigation report on competition on digital markets. The report is the result of 16 months investigation launched against the Big 4 tech giants- Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon.10
In particular, the Indian competition watchdog isn’t the first antitrust regulator to have initiated an investigation against WhatsApp over its new privacy policy. On January 11, the Turkish Competition Authority announced that it will launch an investigation against Facebook and WhatsApp to determine whether there’s been an abuse of market dominant position.11 Moreover, only last year on June 23, 2020, the (German) Federal Court of Justice held Facebook guilty of abusing its dominant position by sharing data across platforms without their users’ consent.12 Recently on March 24, 2021, the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf halted the proceedings and filed a request for a preliminary ruling before the European Court of Justice (‘ECJ’) thereby putting the ball in their court.13
 
Conclusion
It is evident from the trends indicated in this note that Antitrust enforcers around the world are becoming increasingly active in launching cases against the big tech companies. At the same time, many countries are actively enacting new privacy laws. Be that as it may, the trends beg the question: How is the intersection between data privacy laws and competition law going to affect the business community? Apart from ongoing proceedings against WhatsApp’s updated privacy policy, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology also issued a cautionary notice to WhatsApp to roll back its update in the privacy policy on May 18, 2021.14 Evidently, the Indian government is taking a hardline stance on the new updates, but WhatsApp is also giving a fair fight in the belief that their policy does not affect personal messages but only business communication, with users having an option to block businesses they want to interact with. However, there is very little certainty on how things are going to unfold for the Big Tech giants in the near future.

622,"June 16, 2021","New Antitrust Bills Zero In Amazon, Apple, Facebook & Google","


Last week US lawmakers fired a shot across Big Tech’s bow, introducing five new bills designed to curb what lawmakers have described as “unregulated power” held by the firms of Silicon Valley. If enacted, the legislation would mark the biggest changes to US antitrust law in decades.
And while the legislation will affect all firms, their congressional architects have been open in naming the specific targets of the legislation.
“Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google have prioritized power over innovation and harmed American businesses and consumers in the process,” Rep. Ken Buck (R-Col.), the ranking member on the House antitrust subcommittee, said in a statement. “These companies have maintained monopoly power in the online marketplace by using a variety of anticompetitive behaviors to stifle competition.”
The new pieces of legislation would prohibit a dominant platform from discriminating against rivals by offering its own products preference (American Innovation and Choice Online Act); stop firms from using acquisitions as a means of neutralizing potential threats (Platform Competition and Opportunity Act); ban dominant platform from using their power across multiple types of business to give themselves unfair advantages (Ending Platform Monopolies Act); make it easier for consumers to move their data when they want to switch to a new provider (Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching Act); and change filing fees for the first time in two decades, providing the government funds to pursue antitrust actions.
Those bills are a long way and a lot of subcommittee hearings between now and becoming law — though regulation of Big Tech is one of the few areas where bipartisan action is still possible, as both Republicans and Democrats have qualms about the power Big Tech wields, and a determined interest in reining it in. And while the players most directly targeted by the new bills have not as yet offered any public comment, they will get their chance this week as they have been invited to appear before the House to testify.

623,"June 14, 2021",Facebook Oculus Acquires BigBox VR,"


BigBox VR, maker of the virtual reality game “Population: One,” has been acquired by Oculus owner Facebook for an undisclosed amount, according to announcements by both companies.
By teaming up with Facebook, BigBox VR can advance its social gaming experience as well as “pursue future projects” according to the company’s press release, which thanked its Population: One community, “for making us the most social first-person shooter in VR.” 
Seattle-based studio BigBox VR stated that the acquisition by Facebook will not change the operations and Population: One will still be present on Discord, Reddit, and other social platform channels. The game is now among BigBox VR’s most popular titles.
Oculus wrote in a blog post that the multiplayer experience in gaming was elevated with VR and with the tie-up with BogBox VR will help developers that “foster social connections.” 
Facebook acquired Oculus for US$2 billion in 2014, and its acquisition of BigBox will fold into the Oculus family and work and help support and expand Population: One.  
“BigBox VR may be small, but they are a mighty, nimble team of game industry vets who seamlessly nail the game development duality of craft and data-driven live service,” Facebook said on the Oculus blog.
In a commitment to maintaining the developer’s “nimble, iterative, creative culture,” Population: One will also continue to be supported on non-Oculus platforms. Facebook Oculus acquires BigBox VR.
When Facebook first acquired Oculus, there was chatter that the virtual reality movement was in full force, but augmented reality (AR) probably helped it take off. A year after the release of Pokémon Go, Apple released its first AR-based software development suite ARKit.

624,"June 4, 2021",UK & EU Hit Facebook With New Antitrust Suit,"
Regulators in the UK and the EU launched formal competition investigations into Facebook at the same time on Friday, marking a rare coordinated probe on a big US tech firm, reported The Wall Street Journal. 
The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority said it is investigating whether Facebook is abusing a dominant position in the social media or digital advertising markets through its collection and use of ad data.
The CMA said it will look into whether Facebook has unfairly used the data gained from its advertising and single sign-on option, known as Facebook Login, to benefit its buying and selling platform, Facebook Marketplace, as well as its online dating service, Facebook Dating.
Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said in a statement: “We intend to thoroughly investigate Facebook’s use of data to assess whether its business practices are giving it an unfair advantage in the online dating and classified ad sectors.”
He added: “Any such advantage can make it harder for competing firms to succeed, including new and smaller businesses, and may reduce customer choice.”
Meanwhile, The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, said it was opening a formal antitrust investigation to assess whether Facebook breached its rules “by using advertising data gathered in particular from advertisers in order to compete with them in markets where Facebook is active such as classified ads.”
The investigation will also seek to determine whether the link between the main Facebook social network and Facebook Marketplace is in breach of EU competition rules.
Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission’s executive vice president, said in a statement: “Facebook is used by almost 3 billion people on a monthly basis and almost 7 million firms advertise on Facebook in total. Facebook collects vast troves of data on the activities of users of its social network and beyond, enabling it to target specific customer groups.”
“We will look in detail at whether this data gives Facebook an undue competitive advantage in particular on the online classified ads sector, where people buy and sell goods every day, and where Facebook also competes with companies from which it collects data. In today’s digital economy, data should not be used in ways that distort competition,” added Vestager.

625,"June 1, 2021",Google & Facebook To Pay For Media Content Under New Australian Law,"


Australia’s competition regulator has declared victory in a three-year battle to make Facebook and Google pay for news after the internet groups signed deals with publishers that could be worth about AU$200 million (US$155.33 million) a year, reported 
Rod Sims, chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, told the Financial Times on Tuesday, June 1, that the country’s world-first news media bargaining code had forced big technology platforms to the negotiating table to agree deals with publishers. 
“We are on track for deals all around. It’s been a big success,” Sims said in an interview. “We are just about there and the media companies are happy — and that’s the key point.” Sims made the comments after confirmation from Nine Entertainment that it had signed a multiyear content deal with Google and Facebook. 
The company, owner of the 190-year-old Sydney Morning Herald, did not release commercial terms of the agreement but forecast that its publishing unit’s earnings would jump AU$30 – $40 million (US$23 – $31 million) in the 2022 financial year. Australia’s other big media groups, including News Corp, Seven West Media, and state broadcaster ABC, have either completed content deals with Facebook and Google or signed letters of intent to do so. 
Dozens of smaller publishers have also struck agreements or are negotiating terms following passage of a law in February designed to make Big Tech pay for news.

626,"May 26, 2021",Facebook May Face New EU Antitrust Probe,"
Facebook is likely to face its first EU antitrust investigation in the coming weeks as regulators zoom in on its online marketplace after rivals complained about the service, a person familiar with the matter said.
The move by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager would make Facebook the latest US tech giant to be in her crosshairs following cases against Alphabet’s Google, Apple, and Amazon.
Facebook’s online marketplace, launched in 2016, is used by 800 million Facebook users in 70 countries to buy and sell items. It drew scrutiny in 2019 from the European Commission, which sent out questionnaires seeking details about its role in relation to rivals in online classified ads, an EU document seen by Reuters at the time showed.
Companies were asked at that time whether they see Facebook Marketplace as a close rival in online classified ads services and how many visits to their sites came from ads placed on Facebook’s site.
Classified ads competitors complained that Facebook uses its market power to give it an unfair competitive advantage, people familiar with the matter had told Reuters.
Opening an investigation would mark the start of a lengthy process that could take years before regulators issue a decision that could include a fine as much as 10% of global turnover and an order to stop anti-competitive practices.

627,"May 19, 2021",Facebook Wants To Add Pay-Per-View Sports,"


The first pay-per-view sporting event happened more than 60 years ago, when boxing fans mailed US$2 to the TelePrompTer company to watch Floyd Patterson retake the title. Of course, consumers’ media consumption habits have changed quite a bit since 1960, something Facebook is banking on as it unveils a plan to turn its live events into a pay-per-view option for sports leagues that broadcast their games on the social media platform.
According to CNBC, Facebook foresees a future where high school athletic teams and smaller sports leagues are “using the feature that allows users to make money for virtual attendance and keep ticket profits — for now.” Facebook also plans to invest in paid online events, in which customers would buy virtual tickets to watch live-streamed events, similar to pay-per-view.
“For decades, media networks such as HBO and Showtime have used the pay-per-view fees, especially for boxing,” the CNBC report stated. “WWE and mixed martial arts company UFC also earned money from pay-per-view events. And the business model is precisely that — paying to watch an event, no subscription needed.”
Rob Shaw, director of sports media and league partnerships for Facebook, told the network that the move could help to revitalize pay-per-view. “People are willing to experience a moment,” he said, but added, “One thing I’ve noticed, though: I don’t think people are willing to immediately start with a subscription.”
Facebook launched its paid online events last year, which is now available in 44 markets around the world. Its April earnings report showed Facebook with 2.8 billion active users each month and 1.8 billion daily active users. In other words, CNBC noted, the audience is there.

628,"May 16, 2021",Court Allows Irish Regulator To Proceed With Inquiry Into Facebook Data,"


Facebook lost a bid to block a European Union privacy decision that could suspend its ability to send information about European users to US computer servers, opening a pathway toward a precedent-setting interruption of its data flows.
Ireland’s High Court dismissed Friday all of Facebook’s procedural complaints about a preliminary decision on data flows that it received in August from the country’s Data Protection Commission. It rejected Facebook’s claims that the privacy regulator had given it too little time to respond or issued a judgment prematurely. 
The preliminary decision, which the court stayed in September pending its decision, could, if finalized, force the social-media company to suspend sending personal information about EU users to Facebook’s servers in the US.
While Friday’s court decision is a procedural one, the underlying questions are central to trans-Atlantic trade and the digital economy. Legal experts say the logic in Ireland’s provisional order could apply to other large tech companies that are subject to U.S. surveillance laws, such as cloud services and email providers—potentially leading to widespread disruption of trans-Atlantic data flows. In the balance are potentially billions of dollars of business in the cloud-computing, social-media and advertising industries.

629,"May 13, 2021",Facebook Loses UK Appeal Over Giphy Merger,"


Facebook has lost an appeal over an investigation by UK regulators into its acquisition of gif-sharing platform Giphy
The social network announced a US$400 million deal to buy Giphy in May last year.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated last June that it was looking into whether the takeover could cause a “substantial lessening of competition in any market or markets in the United Kingdom.”
The watchdog ordered Facebook and Giphy to keep their businesses separate, not to integrate their IT systems or customers lists, and not to exchange sensitive information during the course of the investigation.
Facebook asked the CMA to vary that order so it only applied to the tech giant’s business “insofar as it related to the supply or procurement of gifs.”
The tech giant claimed that the initial enforcement order (IEO) was disproportionate as it applied “across hundreds of businesses and more than 50,000 employees worldwide.”

630,"October 24, 2021",Epic Games Opposes Apple’s Wish To Pause Antitrust Trial,"


On Friday, October 22, “Fortnite” creator Epic Games opposed Apple’s efforts to put on hold orders handed down in an antitrust trial as a potentially lengthy appeals process plays out.
In September, US district Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Roger struck down some of the iPhone maker’s App Store rules, including a prohibition on developers directing their users to other payment options beside Apple’s in-app payment system, in a partial win for Epic and other app makers.
According to Reuters, Apple has until December 9 to comply with the injunction, but earlier this month the company announced it will appeal the ruling and asked Gonzalez Rogers to put her order on hold as the appeals process, which could take more than a year, unfolds.
Epic argued in a court filing that Apple has not met the legal standard for that pause, which requires Apple to show that it will be irreparably harmed by even temporarily complying with the order if the injunction is later reversed on appeal.

Epic stated that Apple’s positive comments about the ruling shortly after it landed, and its delay in asking for a pause, showed that it would not be harmed by enacting the orders.
“The public interest favors denying (Apple’s request); an injunction is the only path to effective relief,” Epic wrote. “History shows … that in the absence of an injunction, Apple will not make any changes.”

631,"October 17, 2021",Epic Games v. Apple: A Case Summary,"


By Natalia Moreno Belloso (European University Institute)
At the heart of the legal battle between Epic Games and Apple is a set of restrictions Apple imposes on app developers. For instance, Apple prohibits the distribution of iOS apps outside of the App Store, which Apple fully controls. Apple similarly requires developers to exclusively use its own in-app payment system for app purchases and in-app purchases for digital content. Through this system, Apple automatically collects a 30% commission on all such transactions. Dissatisfied with these policies, Epic Games tried to use its flagship game Fortnite as leverage to convince Apple to open up its closed platform. After Apple refused, Epic Games violated the App Store rules by enabling its own payment method in the Fortnite iOS app on August 13, 2020. That same day, Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store and Epic Games filed an antitrust suit in a federal district court in California. Apple soon thereafter countersued for breach of contract. A yearlong trial ensued, the result of which is a 185-page decision, which was handed down by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on September 10, 2021.
This summary condenses the Epic Games v. Apple decision into a six-page overview covering all the main parts of the decision. Part I of the summary covers the findings of fact, which includes the Court’s factual findings on the different product and geographic markets proposed by Epic Games and Apple, on the anticompetitive effects alleged by Epic Games, and on the business justifications put forward by Apple. Part II covers the application of the facts to the law and includes the Court’s legal market definition and market power assessment, its findings under federal antitrust law (Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act) and state antitrust law (California’s Cartwright Act and Unfair Competition Law), and its breach of contract findings.

632,"October 17, 2021",South Korea Investigates Apple Over Payment Rules,"


Apple may be facing an investigation by the government of South Korea over whether the tech giant is truly complying with the nation’s new requirements dealing with its payment systems.
As Reuters reported Friday (Oct. 15), the issue stems from South Korea’s recent changes to the Telecommunication Business Act in an effort to prevent tech giants Apple and Google for charging developers commissions on in-app purchases.
The law went into effect in September, with Apple telling the government of South Korea that it was already in compliance and didn’t need to update its app store policy.
“This goes against the purpose of the amended law,” one Korean Communications Commission official said, asking for anonymity as the government was still in talks with Apple.
The KCC will ask Apple’s South Korean operations for a new policy that gives more autonomy in payment methods. If Apple doesn’t comply, the KCC will consider conducting a fact-finding probe ahead of possible fines or other penalties.
The KCC official said Google had informed the commission it would comply with the law and allow third-party payment systems and would discuss the matter with the KCC next week.
Neither Google or Apple replied to requests for comment.
Apple has more to lose here than Google, said Jung Jong-chae, a lawyer who specializes in antitrust matters.
“(The) differences between Apple and Google in willingness to give ground may be because Apple controls everything from hardware to operating system (OS) to app market to payment system,” he said, “and (Apple) has more to lose if its dominance breaks on any front, which could lead to calls for openness on other fronts.”

633,"October 13, 2021",Apple Says There Are Security Risks If EU Opens Its Software,"


On Wednesday, October 13, Apple ramped up its criticism of EU draft rules that would force it to allow users to install software from outside its App Store, claiming that would boost the risk of cybercriminals and malware.
But the Coalition for App Fairness, which includes Spotify, Match Group, and Epic Games, dismissed Apple’s arguments, and stated that built-in security measures such as encrypted data and antivirus programs provide security to devices, not the App Store.
The group wants regulators to loosen Apple’s grip on its App Store so they can bypass it to reach Apple’s hundreds of millions of users and also to avoid paying commissions of up to 30% for purchases made in the Store.
The iPhone maker has been a fierce critic of EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager’s proposed rules, announced last year in a bid to rein in Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet unit Google.
Building on CEO Tim Cook’s comments in June about the risks to privacy and security of iPhones, on Wednesday Apple published an analysis on the threats of so-called side-loading. 
“If Apple were forced to support sideloading, more harmful apps would reach users because it would be easier for cybercriminals to target them – even if sideloading were limited to third-party app stores only,” the report stated.

634,"October 10, 2021",Apple Files Appeal In Epic Games Case,"


Apple filed a notice of appeal in the Epic Games case and is asking for a stay on the injunction that lets developers add in-app links to payment websites, according to company representatives and documents filed on Friday, October 8.
If Apple wins the stay, which will be decided by a judge in November, a rule change potentially allowing developers to circumvent App Store fees of 15% to 30% may not take effect until appeals in the case have finished, a process that could take years.
In September, federal judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled in favor of Apple for nine of 10 counts in an antitrust trial brought by Epic, the maker of Fortnite. Epic was seeking the ability to install its own app store on iPhones. Kate Adams, Apple’s general counsel, said at the time the ruling was a “huge win.”
Related: Court Issues Mixed Ruling in Epic v. Apple Antitrust Trial
But Apple was also ordered to make a major change to its store and allow mobile apps to steer consumers to outside payment methods, potentially providing a way to evade Apple’s App Store fees.
That injunction is currently scheduled to go into effect on December 9.
Apple hasn’t publicly explained how its App Store policies would change under the order, but some developers have already started to build software based on their interpretation of the ruling.
“At a high level, it is my judgment that, without thoughtful restrictions in place to protect consumers, developers, and the iOS platform, this change will harm users, developers, and the iOS platform more generally,” Trystan Kosmynka, Apple’s senior director of App Review, said in a filing on Friday.

635,"October 7, 2021",Japan Opens New Apple Antitrust Probe,"


Japan’s Fair Trade Commission will investigate whether Apple is leveraging their dominance in the smartphone operating system market to eliminate competition and severely limit options for consumers, reported Nikkei. 
The study will involve interviews and surveys with OS operators, app developers and smartphone users, commission Secretary-General Shuichi Sugahisa told reporters Wednesday. The initiative will explore market conditions not only for smartphones, but for smartwatches and other wearables.
The antitrust watchdog will compile a report outlining OS market structure and the reason why competition has remained static. The commission will work with the central government’s Digital Market Competition Council, which is moving forward with its own market probe.
Practices found to be anticompetitive will be itemized in the report, along with possible violations of Japan’s law against monopolies.
In February, the government implemented the Act on Improving Transparency and Fairness of Digital Platforms. If officials decide that the law applies to the OS market, OS operators will be told to submit regular reports on transactions to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
In Japan, Apple’s iOS commands a nearly 70% share among smartphone operating systems while Android’s share stands at 30%. Any developer of apps — whether they specialize in music, streaming videos, e-books or mobile games — need to match the software with specifications of the operating systems if they want to appear on smartphones.

636,"October 7, 2021",Court Issues Mixed Ruling in Epic v. Apple Antitrust Trial,"


By Christopher M. Wyant & Ruby A. Nagamine, National Law Review
On 10 September 2021, the Northern District of California issued a highly anticipated decision in the Epic Games, Inc. v. Apple Inc. antitrust dispute. The case centered on whether Apple’s operation of its App Store violates U.S. and California antitrust laws and California Unfair Competition Law. The result was mixed. The court found that Apple was not in violation of antitrust laws, but it did find Apple had violated California’s Unfair Competition Law. The court ordered Apple to allow apps to link to payment mechanisms outside of Apple’s in-app payment system (where Apple collects a 30% commission on every sale). The court’s injunction leaves room for interpretation, and the true impact of the decision will depend in part on how Apple and app developers implement the court’s injunction, if and when it goes into effect.
BACKGROUND
Since unveiling the iPhone in 2007, Apple has maintained tight control over its mobile operating system, known as iOS. The only way to install software (apps) onto iOS devices is through the App Store. Apple does not allow other app stores or the installation of software from the Internet on its devices. This closed system is sometimes referred to as a “walled garden.” To use the App Store, developers must sign a Developer Product Licensing Agreement (DPLA), which requires developers to use Apple’s in-app payment system for all app transactions and pay a 30% commission to Apple on all app sales and in-app purchases.2 Stated differently, if a developer wants to distribute its app to iOS users, its only option is to use the App Store and pay a 30% commission to Apple every timer a user pays to download the app, sign up for a subscription, or make an in-app purchase.3 Developers must also agree to Apple’s anti-steering provisions, which prohibit developers from (i) providing buttons or links within an app to outside payment systems, (ii) contacting customers acquired through iOS to encourage use of outside payment systems, or (iii) informing customers of Apple’s 30% commission.

637,"October 7, 2021",Dutch Watchdog Rules Apple App Store Violated Payment Rules,"


The Netherlands antitrust authority has found that Apple’s rules requiring software developers to use its in-app payment system are anti-competitive and ordered it to make changes, reported Reuters.
Apple’s app-store payment policies, in particular its requirement that app developers exclusively use its payment system where commissions range between 15% and 30%, have long drawn complaints from developers.
The Dutch investigation into whether Apple’s practices amounted to an abuse of a dominant market position was launched in 2019 but later reduced in scope to focus primarily on dating market apps.
They included a complaint from Match Group, owner of the popular dating service Tinder, which claimed that Apple’s rules were hindering it from direct communications with its customers about payments.
The Netherlands’ Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) last month informed the US technology giant of its decision, making it the first antitrust regulator to make a finding the company has abused market power in the app store, though Apple is facing challenges in multiple countries.
Related: Match Asks Dutch Watchdog To Reveal Apple Antitrust Decision
The ACM has not levied a fine against Apple, but demanded changes to the in-app payment system, the people said. The decision has not been seen by Reuters.
An ACM spokesperson declined to comment, saying that the matter is currently under legal review. The regulator has previously said it expects to publish its decision this year.
Apple was not immediately available to comment. The company argues its app store rules ensure security and privacy for its users.

638,"October 6, 2021",Apple May Face New EU Antitrust Fine Over NFC Chip,"
According to Reuters, Apple will face a new EU antitrust charge over its NFC chip technology, a move that puts it at risk of a possible hefty fine and could force it to open its mobile payment system to rivals.
Apple has been in European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager’s crosshairs since June last year when she launched an investigation into Apple Pay.
Preliminary concerns were Apple’s NFC chip which enables tap-and-go payments on iPhones, its terms and conditions on how mobile payment service Apple Pay should be used in merchants’ apps and websites, and the company’s refusal to allow rivals access to the payment system.
The European Commission has since narrowed its focus to just the NFC chip, which can only be accessed by Apple Pay, one of the sources said.
The EU competition enforcer is now preparing a charge sheet known as a statement of objections, which could be sent to Apple next year, one of the sources said. Such documents typically set out practices considered anti-competitive by the regulator.
The Commission, which has three other cases against Apple, declined to comment. It can fine companies up to 10% of their global turnover for violating EU rules, which based on Apple’s 2020 revenue could come to $27.4 billion.

639,"October 5, 2021",Chinese Top Court OKs “Apple Tax” Antitrust Case To Proceed,"


A Chinese consumer has been given the go-ahead to take an “Apple tax” antitrust case to court, as China’s Supreme Court rejected Apple’s call for the lawsuit to be thrown out.
A local report stated that this is a small legal loss, but could have big implications for the Cupertino company.
South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported that China’s Supreme Court has made a civil ruling in favor of a consumer versus the China subsidiary of Apple, in a legal development lawyers say could open the gates for more consumers in the country to file similar complaints against the iPhone maker in local courts.
The case involves Jin Xin, who is demanding Apple stop charging 30% commission on purchases in the China App Store, and to allow Chinese consumers to make payments through wallets other than Apple Pay, to provide 100,000 yuan (US$15,500) in compensation and to issue a public apology.
In his lawsuit Jin alleges that the prices of in-app services offered by apps in Apple’s App Store, including video app iQiyi, podcast app Himalaya, and music app NetEase Music, are higher than in Android app stores – possibly as a result of Apple’s 30%t App store commission. Jin also cites China’s Anti-Monopoly Law in accusing Apple of “anticompetitive” practices.

640,"June 23, 2019","5 Lessons From Microsoft’s Antitrust Woes, by People Who Lived It","
By Steve Lohr, New York Times
The nation’s antitrust enforcers and Congress are stepping up their scrutiny of the tech giants. Disruptive investigations, federal lawsuits and new rules could loom for Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple.
The companies and their executives don’t need to look far for guidance about how this could all play out. One of their top competitors, Microsoft, faced the government’s ire in the 1990s, leading to a bruising battle in federal court. The company was found to have repeatedly violated the nation’s antitrust laws, and it agreed to change its corporate behavior as part of an eventual settlement.
“The Microsoft case is incredibly front and center, the road map, in all these discussions about big tech and antitrust,” said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University and co-author of “The Microsoft Antitrust Cases: Competition Policy for the Twenty-First Century.”

641,"May 7, 2019","US: Microsoft, Starbucks team up","
Starbucks is teaming up with Microsoft on AI-powered projects that will do everything from gathering customer preferences to connecting coffeemakers.
This isn’t the first time the companies have worked together. In fact, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson is a former Microsoft executive.
The two companies revealed some of the projects they are working on at Microsoft’s Build developers conference on Monday (May 6). Predictive drive-thru ordering, for example, would give customers recommendations based on order history. While it’s unknown if the AI technology will evolve to include facial recognition software or license plate readers that can be used to recommend a customer’s favorite order, Microsoft did say that customers will eventually be able to agree to more personalized drive-thru recommendations.
Starbucks is also using several Azure cloud products to connect and secure the more than a dozen pieces of equipment in each of its 30,000 stores. The goal is to connect its devices to the cloud, making it easier to keep track of maintenance needs instead of waiting for breakdowns to occur. The machines operate 16 hours a day at high volume, and any mechanical issues can bring store operations to a standstill.
In addition, Microsoft is working with Starbucks on a new blockchain program. The revelation coincides with the tech giant’s announcement earlier this week that it has launched Azure Blockchain Service, which simplifies the formation, management and governance of cons...

January 2019
CPI EU News Column edited by Thibault Schrepel, Sam Sadden & Jan Roth (CPI) presents:
Commission Approval For Microsoft’s $7.5 Billion Github Acquisition CASE M.8994 – MICROSOFT / GITHUB By Pim Jansen (Van Doorne N.V.)1
On October 19, 2018, following its phase I investigation, the European Commission (“Commission”) approved the proposed acquisition of GitHub Inc. (“GitHub”) by Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”). This short analysis aims to provide further insight into the Commission’s decision. I will first provide a summary of the relevant facts, followed by a brief overview of the Commission’s reasoning. Afterwards, I will provide some further thoughts on this case.
Essential Facts
On June 4, 2018, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft announced its intention to acquire sole control over San Francisco-based GitHub for USD 7.5 billion in Microsoft stock (the “Transaction”).2 Pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger signed on the same date, GitHub would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft. On  September 14, 2018, the proposed concentration was notified to the Commission.
Microsoft is active in the design, development and supply of computer software (including various software development and operations (“DevOps”) tools), hardware devices and related services, cloud-based solutions, online advertising, recruiting, and professional social network services. GitHub is active in the supply of DevOps tools and in...

643,"November 14, 2018",Due Process and Production of Documents Stored Abroad: A Review of Antitrust Discovery Tools After Microsoft Ireland and the Cloud Act,"
By Valeria Losco & Terry Calvani 
This article discusses one specific issue raised by new technologies in antitrust investigations: the production of documents stored abroad. Until recently government agencies could only request the production of documents available on the territory where they had jurisdiction, but new technologies have challenged the concept of what is “available” in a particular territory. Generally the governing law is silent in this respect. Over the last couple of years legislatures and courts around the globe have started to address this issue. This article reviews these recent developments, with a particular focus on U.S. antitrust proceedings and an overview of the main developments in Canada and Europe.

644,"October 21, 2018",EU: Microsoft’s US$7.5b GitHub acquisition approved,"
Microsoft’s upcoming US$7.5 billion acquisition of GitHub has cleared another major hurdle: the EU has approved the deal after determining that there are no antitrust concerns in Microsoft buying the popular open-source software repository, reported the Financial Times.
European antitrust authorities have reportedly determined that “the merged entity would continue to face significant ongoing competition from other players.” Officials also aren’t concerned that Microsoft could “undermine the open nature of GitHub,” noting that developers have other options they could switch to if Microsoft’s stewardship of the platform isn’t to their liking.
The GitHub purchase was first announced in June this year, with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella commenting at the time, “We are committed to being stewards of the GitHub community, which will retain its developer-first ethos, operate independently and remain an open platform. We will always listen to developer feedback and invest in both fundamentals and new capabilities.”

According to Reuters, US software giant Microsoft is set to win unconditional EU antitrust approval for its US$7.5 billion purchase of privately held coding website GitHub.
GitHub, the world’s largest code host, has more than 28 million developers using its platform. It will become a part of Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit once the acquisition is completed.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has tried to assuage users’ worries that GitHub might favor Microsoft products over competitors after the deal, saying GitHub would continue to be an open platform that works with all public clouds.
“Microsoft is a developer-first company, and by joining forces with GitHub we strengthen our commitment to developer freedom, openness and innovation,” Nadella said in a release when announcing the deal in May.

Back in June, Microsoft announced plans to acquire GitHub for US$7.5 billion. As reported by Reuters, the EU will be ruling on Microsoft’s GitHub acquisition on October 19.
In an effort to quell any antitrust concerns, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has assured users that GitHub will continue to be an open platform and will remain compatible with public cloud services.
GitHub, the world’s largest code host with more than 28 million developers using its platform, is Microsoft’s largest takeover since the company bought LinkedIn for US$26 billion in 2016.
“Microsoft is a developer-first company, and by joining forces with GitHub we strengthen our commitment to developer freedom, openness and innovation,” Nadella said in a release announcing the deal in May.

En entrevista con Andy Serwer, editor en jefe de Yahoo Finance,  se le preguntó al antiguo CEO de Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, cómo ve las condiciones actuales que se yerguen sobre la industria de la tecnología. Su respuesta: las compañías tecnológicas deberían tratar de trabajar rápidamente con el gobierno para encontrar una solución, a diferencia de lo que Microsoft hizo durante su mandato, cuando se enfrentó a una demanda antimonopolio del gobierno.
“No estoy tratando de decir  ‘ay de mí’, pero recuerden que recibimos una demanda antimonopolio en Microsoft por parte del [Departamento de Justicia de los Estados Unidos]. Esto del gobierno […] es algo serio. Y sabiendo lo que sé ahora, habría resuelto los problemas”, dijo Ballmer.
“Creo que debimos haber resuelto antes cómo arreglar las cosas. No creo que haya sido útil para nuestra empresa el camino que tomamos. Creo que la industria de la tecnología ahora podría […] repetir esa experiencia “.
Continuó: “Creo que aceptar completamente que las cosas no son como deben ser, y ponerse a trabajar en esos temas de tal manera que la gente entienda que lo tomamos en serio, en lugar de que la industria tecnológica parezca generalmente arrogante.”
Facebook ha estado plagado de escándalos, desde la propagación de propaganda rusa hasta el escándalo de Cambridge Analytica. Google, Microsoft y Amazon se han visto sacudidos por las protestas internas de sus empleados contra los contratos de la compañía con órganos militares y policiacos. Existe un cuestionamiento cada vez mayor respecto a si la industria tecnológica tiene demasiado poder, e incluso se ha sugerido la necesidad de tomar acciones antimonopolio.
Ballmer está instando a la industria tecnológica a aceptar que hay un problema y a trabajar con los reguladores para solucionarlo.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance editor-in-chief Andy Serwer, Microsoft’s former chief executive Steve Ballmer was asked how he sees the current storm clouds over the tech industry playing out. His answer: Tech companies should try to work quickly with government to find a solution—unlike what Microsoft did under his tenure, as it faced an antitrust suit from the government.
“I’m not trying to do a ‘woe is me’ thing, but remember we got by an antitrust lawsuit at Microsoft by the [US Department of Justice]. This government stuff […] it’s serious stuff. And knowing what I know now, I would have resolved the issues,” Ballmer said.
“I think we should have figured out how to settle matters out earlier than we did. I do not think it was helpful for our company, the path we took. I think the tech industry right now […] could well repeat that experience.”
He went on, “I think fully accepting that things are not the way they need to be, and going to work on those issues in a way that people understand you are serious about, as opposed to the tech industry generally appearing arrogant, I understand that.”
Facebook has been beset by scandals, from the spread of Russian propaganda to Cambridge Analytica scandal. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have been roiled by internal employee protests against company contracts with the military and law enforcement agencies. There is growing scrutiny of whether the tech industry has too much power, and suggestions of antitrust action are being thrown around.
Ballmer is urging the tech industry to get over it, accept there’s a problem, and work with regulators to fix it.

Microsoft has acquired Flipgrid, a video discussion platform used by more than 20 million teachers and students around the world. Flipgrid is a platform that allows students to discuss and reply to topics with video clips at home or in the classroom, reported CNBC.
The move shows Microsoft remains eager to win share in education, where Google’s Chromebooks have become popular.
Microsoft is making Flipgrid free of charge. Schools that already have subscriptions will receive prorated refunds, Microsoft said.
The acquisition comes 1½ years after Microsoft announced a partnership with Flipgrid. Today, Flipgrid integrates with many Microsoft products, including Teams for chatting with other people and OneNote for taking notes. But Flipgrid has paid to use Amazon Web Services cloud, which competes with Microsoft’s own Azure.

650,"March 13, 2022","EU Launches Antitrust Probe On Google, Facebook Over Ad Deal","


The European Commission has formally opened an antitrust probe into a 2018 deal between tech giants Google and Facebook allegedly aimed at cementing their dominance over the online advertising market, reported Bloomberg. 
The EU’s executive said it was investigating the so-called “Jedi Blue” agreement to see if it had been used to “restrict and distort competition in the already concentrated ad tech market.”
The European Commission announced its formal antitrust investigation in a press release in which it voiced its concerns that an agreement between the two companies in 2018 may have breached EU competition rules. 
Meanwhile, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that the deal may have restricted or prevented the uptake of header bidding services.
The Jedi Blue agreement came under fire in the United States in September 2021, after four members of Congress asked the Justice Department to launch a criminal investigation into whether the pact violated federal antitrust laws.
Header bidding is a service that allows sellers like news publishers to offer their online advertising space to multiple buyers at the same time as opposed to doing so on an individual basis. This makes it so that buyers (or in this case advertisers) must compete against each other for ad space while publishers can compare bids from multiple buyers at the same time.

651,"March 11, 2022",CMA Probes Google & Facebook Over Ad Tech,"
The UK’s CMA is taking a closer look at Google and Meta’s conduct over concerns that they hampered competition in markets for online display advertising services.
CMA Chief Executive said “We will not shy away from scrutinising the behaviour of big tech firms while we await powers for the Digital Markets Unit.”
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is focusing on whether the companies restricted or prevented the uptake of header bidding services and whether Google also affected the ability of other firms to compete with its products in this area.
Header bidding is a service which allows sellers, such as news publishers, to offer their online advertising space to multiple buyers at the same time, rather than receiving offers one by one. As a result, buyers – or advertisers – compete against each other for ad space and publishers can compare bids from multiple buyers simultaneously. This competition between buyers can make auctions more competitive.
As part of its investigation, the CMA will consider whether an agreement between Google and Meta (previously Facebook) – which Google internally codenamed “Jedi Blue” – broke the law. This secret pact was the focus of an investigation in the United States looking into the claim that Google executives “induced” senior Facebook staff to agree to a plan to undermine competition in digital advertising.
The CMA is also scrutinising Google’s conduct in relation to header bidding services...

652,"March 8, 2022",Google In Deal To Buy to Cybersecurity Firm Mandiant For $5.4B,"
Alphabet’s Google has a $5.4 billion deal in place for the acquisition of cybersecurity firm Mandiant, a move intended to complement Google Cloud’s security strengths and better protect customers.  
The $23 per share, all-cash deal included Mandiant’s net cash and is expected to close later this year. Upon closing, Mandiant will be folded into Google Cloud to create an “end-to-end security operations suite,” according to a Mandiant press statement on Tuesday (March 8). 
“This is an opportunity to deliver an end-to-end security operations suite and extend one of the best consulting organizations in the world. Together we can make a profound impact in securing the cloud, accelerating the adoption of cloud computing, and ultimately make the world safer,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud.
Founded in 2004, Mandiant’s more than 600 cybersecurity consultants respond to thousands of breaches annually. Research from over 300 intelligence analysts power Mandiant’s security tools, delivered across Mandiant Advantage, a multi-vendor XDR platform.
“Cyber security is a mission, and we believe it’s one of the most important of our generation. Google Cloud shares our mission-driven culture to bring security to every organization,” said Kevin Mandia, CEO, Mandiant. 
“Together, we will deliver our expertise and intelligence at scale via the Mandiant Advantage SaaS platform, as part of the Google Cloud security portfolio. These efforts will help organizations to effectively, efficiently and continuously manage and configure their complex mix of security products,” Mandia said. 
Google has been increasing its presence in cloud computing and cybersecurity in recent years by acquiring providers, such as Israeli startup Siemplify in January,  and expanding its in-house capabilities as well. The move appears geared towards increasing Google’s clout in the growing e-finance business, with financial institutions increasingly turning to the Cloud for their operations.

653,"March 3, 2022",Seoul High Court Rules Against S. Korean Watchdog In Google Suit,"


A court ruling has temporarily suspended the Korean Fair Trade Commission’s order that Google fix its unfair market practices, reported KBS World. 
The Seoul High Court on Monday sided with the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed by Google, Google Asia Pacific and Google Korea against the trade regulator. The decision is an important, if temporary victory for the internet giant, which has faced a series of challenges from National Competition Authorities in recent years. 
The commission last year ordered corrective measures and imposed fines on the global tech giant for forcing smartphone makers to only use its Android mobile operating system. The decision in this case echoes similar findings in other jurisdictions, including the European Union, the UK, and Turkey.
Google then filed the lawsuit in January to overturn that decision and separately applied for an injunction with the Seoul High Court.
The court has decided to suspend the KFTC’s order until August 31, saying a deferment is necessary to prevent irreparable damage to the plaintiffs.
The court did rule, however, that the 224-point-nine-billion-won fine imposed on Google remains valid. In addition to the operating system, Google is also accused of requiring smartphone makers to enter into an “anti-fragmentation agreement” when they sign key license contracts with Google.
The KFTC had determined that Google was abusing its market dominance and hampering competition.

654,"February 20, 2022","Report Alleges Microsoft, Google Maybe Using Spam Ads To Stifle Competition","


Confidential data reviewed by POLITICO has revealed gatekeeper search engines are funneling low-value ads to smaller search partners.
The report alleges Alphabet’s Google and Microsoft Corp. are using the online advertising market to the detriment of smaller rivals. The action threatens to establish a new antitrust clash in Europe, reported PMNTS. 
These two tech giants appear to be inundating smaller search engine partners with spam ads while keeping the most valuable adverts for themselves, the report found.
The report comes a week after the European Publishers Council (EPC) — an association that includes The New York Times, Germany’s Axel Springer and the UK’s Guardian — filed a complaint with the European Commission against Google, asking the regulator to restore conditions for effective competition in the AdTech value chain.
The European Commission has been investigating Google’s advertising practices since last year, when it sent questionnaires to publishers and advertising companies asking them about the role of Google as middleman in the AdTech value chain.
In addition, the US Department of Justice has been expediting its investigation of Google’s alleged antitrust practices.
Last fall, Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s commissioner for competition, said the European Parliament and European Council should approve legislation regulating Big Tech as soon as possible.
The data, compiled by anonymous researchers working in the AdTech space, found that Google and Microsoft release “low-value and irrelevant ads” to their partners.

655,"February 16, 2022",UK Has Google Change Privacy Policy On Android,"


Google is expanding its Privacy Sandbox to Android devices and the UK’s antitrust watchdog is set to play a crucial role in ensuring that the tech giant does not abuse its market dominance in the process, reported EurActiv. 
On Wednesday (16 February), Google presented a multi-year initiative to introduce to Android its Privacy Sandbox, an initiative aimed at “building a more private, open web.”
Until now, the Privacy Sandbox initiative was limited to the web, with a view to restricting cross-site tracking performed by third party cookies via Google’s web browser Chrome. The move to Android is explicitly building on this experience.
“Google appears to follow a similar philosophy for the app ecosystem: replacing existing identifiers that power digital advertising (the Android Advertising ID) with alternative solutions that are said to improve privacy,” said Damien Geradin, founding partner at Geradin Partners.
The blog post announcing the change noted that more than 90% of the apps available on the Google Play app store are free, also thanks to digital advertising. However, the announcement added that the app ecosystem remains healthy, “the industry must continue to evolve how digital advertising works to improve user privacy.”

656,"February 15, 2022",South Korean Regulator Raises Google Antitrust Fine,"


South Korea’s antitrust regulator said Tuesday it has raised the fine slapped on Google over alleged anti-competition practices by 17.5 billion won (US$14.63 million) to 224.9 billion won.
In mid-September, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) decided to fine the global tech giant for forcing smartphone makers into only using its Android mobile operating system. The amount was provisionally set at 207.4 billion won.
The unfair practice, the regulator said, has helped Google cement its market dominance in the mobile platform market and undermined innovation in the development of new OS for smart devices.
The regulator said it had adjusted the penalty to 224.93 billion won before notifying Google of the decision at the end of last year.
The initial fine was calculated with the period of Google’s law violations set from January 2011 to April 2021, the last month for which its sales data was available at that time.

657,"February 13, 2022",UK & Google Settle On Privacy Sandbox Commitments,"


The CMA has accepted a revised offer from Google of commitments relating to its proposed removal of third-party cookies from the Chrome browser, known as the Privacy Sandbox proposals.
The Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) competition investigation was launched in January 2021 over concerns that the proposals would cause online advertising spending to become even more concentrated on Google, weakening competition and so harming consumers who ultimately pay for the cost of online advertising.
The CMA was also concerned that Google’s proposals could undermine the ability of online publishers, such as newspapers, to generate revenue and continue to produce valuable content in the future – reducing the public’s choice of news sources.
Related: UK To Probe Google’s “Privacy Sandbox’” Changes
The final commitments accepted by the CMA today are a result of an in-depth investigation and extensive engagement with Google and market participants, including 2 formal public consultations.
They address the CMA’s competition concerns and Google has also said that the commitments will be rolled out globally.
The CMA is working closely with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) to oversee the development of the proposals, so that they protect privacy without unduly restricting competition and harming consumers.
Google’s third party cookies currently play a fundamental role online and in digital advertising. They help businesses target advertising effectively and fund free online content for consumers, such as newspapers. But there have also been concerns about their legality and use from a privacy perspective, as they allow consumers’ behavior to be tracked across the web in ways that many consumers may feel uncomfortable with and may find difficult to understand.

658,"February 13, 2022",Google Sues South Korea’s Regulator To Reverse Antitrust Fine,"


Google is asking a judge to reverse the fine it received last year from South Korea’s competition regulator after the tech giant tried to force the country’s phone makers to use its Android operating system, according to PYMNTS.
The lawsuit, filed last month, seeks to cancel a 207.4 billion won ($173 million) penalty imposed by the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC). The sanction is among the largest ever issued by the agency.
Regulators allege Google has hurt competition by requiring smartphone makers to sign anti-fragmentation agreements (AFAs). Under the terms of the contract, Google prevents South Korean manufacturers, including Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, from making changes to the Android OS.
Google has insisted that its AFAs are necessary to ensure that apps work across the Android phone network.
In a separate case, Google appealed that decision. The Seoul High Court is expected to consider the appeal Feb. 25.
The decision by the KFTC prohibited Google from forcing manufacturers to sign AFAs, and the court ordered existing agreements be amended.
Korea has been among the first nations to legislate against the alleged monopolies by Google and Apple in downloading mobile apps to their mobile operating systems.
The country’s Telecommunications Business Act, enacted last fall, prohibits Apple and Google from charging software developers commission on in-app purchases.

659,"February 11, 2022",Publishers File A EU-Wide Antitrust Complaint Against Google,"


Publishers have filed a Europe-wide antitrust complaint against Google accusing it of using ‘unlawful tactics’ to monopolise online advertising and crush competition, giving it a stranglehold over the industry that threatens the free press.
The European Publishers Council (EPC), a group of Chairmen and CEOs of the continent’s leading media groups including MailOnline’s owner Daily Mail and General Trust, has today revealed it is complaining to the European Commission about the tech giant’s digital advertising practices.
They say Google’s advertising platform is ‘rife with conflicts of interests’ because it is acting as buyer and the seller in the same transaction, while also operating the auction house in the middle in a monopoly that harms publishers and consumers across Europe.
The Silicon Valley firm’s position has been compared to ‘Goldman or Citibank owning the New York Stock Exchange’ because it controls both buy-side and sell-side advertising brokers.
Figures show that one of Google’s advertising auction programs dropped publisher revenue by 40%, and there are fears changes to its cookie technology could hit revenues by up to 70%.
Meanwhile it takes advantage of its dominant position to increase its market share at the expense of customers who are locked into Google products.

660,"August 11, 2021",Labor Union Lobbies FTC To Block Amazon-MGM Deal,"


The Strategic Organizing Center (SOC), a federation of labor unions representing close to 4 million workers, Wednesday, August 11, called on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to reject Amazon’s proposed US$8.45 billion acquisition of MGM as a newly vigilant FTC is in the process of scrutinizing the deal that was announced in May.
In a letter sent to the acting director of the FTC’s Competition Bureau, Holly Vedova, SOC Executive Director Michael Zucker claims that Amazon has already employed anti-competitive practices in the streaming video-on-demand market and the proposed deal would let it further leverage its power to the detriment of consumers, competitors, and the film industry.

SOC (formerly Change to Win) includes the Teamsters, Communications Workers of American (CWA), United Farmworkers of America, and Service Employees International Union.
“Amazon’s proposed acquisition of MGM would further bolster Amazon’s ability to leverage power across multiple lines of business related to the SVOD market and create further harmful vertical integration in the film industry at large,” the SOC’s Zucker wrote. “Amazon’s current practices in SVOD and related markets – including leveraging e-commerce power to build SVOD market share, bundling Prime Video with delivery and offering Prime Video at below market prices, and exclusionary use of its dominance in the streaming device and cloud computing markets – already raise serious questions of anti-competitive conduct in the specific market that would be affected by the merger.”

661,"August 9, 2021","Indian Top Court Says Walmart, Amazon To Face Antitrust Probe","


Amazon and Walmart will face antitrust probes in India over their eCommerce practices, India’s Supreme Court ruled on Monday, August 9.
According to Reuters, the ruling stems from an investigation ordered last year by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) into whether Amazon and Walmart’s Indian eCommerce arm, Flipkart, promoted select sellers on their platforms and used tactics that hindered competition.
The two companies stated they will cooperate, but have denied wrongdoing and have fought legal battles against the investigation, arguing that the CCI doesn’t have the evidence it needs to launch the probe.

“The allegations and the evidence before the CCI against the Appellant were qualitatively different from those relating to Amazon … The CCI should have independently examined the case against each of the two platforms,” Flipkart stated in its court filing.
The court said companies such as Amazon and Flipkart should volunteer for investigations in the interest of transparency.
As Reuters pointed out, the decision is a significant step back for the companies, as the Supreme Court was considered their last defense against the CCI investigation.
“In the current antitrust case, filed by trader group Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, the two companies face allegations of exclusive launches of mobile phones, promotion of select sellers on their websites and deep discounting practices that drive out competition,” stated the Reuters report.
Flipkart and Amazon had also asked the Supreme Court to stall the CCI request for information, including details about their top 100 sellers and best-selling items.
The two companies are key players in India’s online retail market, which could be worth US$200 billion by 2026. Last month, Flipkart was valued at US$37 billion, making it India’s largest domestic tech venture. Based in the country’s tech hub in the southern city of Bengaluru, Flipkart now boasts over 350 million registered users and more than 300,000 vendors offering 150 million products.

662,"August 8, 2021",India Court Affirms Amazon Victory Against Future Group-Reliance Deal,"


India’s Supreme Court on Friday, August 6, affirmed an emergency arbitrator’s decision, sought by Amazon, preventing the planned sale of the Future retail chain to Reliance Industries.
Future Group, the court ruling notes, is the second-largest brick-and-mortar retailer in India. Reliance Industries is a giant conglomerate in the country.
In its decision, the Supreme Court India noted that the provisions of a 2019 investment deal involving Amazon and Future Retail Limited had language blocking any asset sale of which Amazon did not approve.
The ruling stated, “It appears that the basic understanding between the parties was that Amazon’s investment in the retail assets of (Future Retail Limited) would continue to vest in (Future Retail Limited), as a result of which (Future Retail Limited) could not transfer its retail assets without (a company partially owned by Amazon’s) consent, which, in turn, could not be granted unless Amazon had provided its consent.”
The decision follows a lengthy court fight that focused in large part on the authority of emergency arbitrators.
Owners of Future Group approved the sale of the retail stores to Alliance in August 2020. In October of 2020, Amazon sought and won the emergency injunction, temporarily blocking the sale.

An Indian court on Friday dismissed appeals by Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Walmart’s (WMT.N) Flipkart that sought to stall an antitrust investigation into their business practices, dealing a major setback to the U.S. firms in a key market.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) last year ordered an inquiry after allegations from brick-and-mortar retailers that the U.S. firms promoted select sellers on their e-commerce platforms and used to business practices that stifle competition.
The investigation was on hold for more than a year after companies challenged it, denying wrongdoing and arguing that the CCI lacked evidence, but a court allowed it to continue in June. On Friday, the High Court in southern Karanataka state rejected the U.S. firms’ appeals.

Walmart’s Flipkart should not be treated the same as rival Amazon in an Indian antitrust probe as the evidence against the two firms was “qualitatively different”, Flipkart argued in a court filing seen by Reuters.
Both Amazon and Flipkart have challenged the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in court as they seek revocation of an Indian court’s June decision to allow an antitrust probe against them to continue. The companies deny any wrongdoing.
India’s government has called the US firms arrogant here and accused them of using legal routes to stall the investigation.
In final submissions made to a court in southern India’s Karnataka state, the Walmart unit argued that CCI and the court “confuse the facts” between the case of Amazon and Flipkart, and overlooked that they were “fierce competitors”.
To back its arguments, it said that a business agreement examined by the CCI before ordering its probe was only between Amazon and its sellers, and there was no such evidence against the Walmart unit.

669,"July 14, 2021",Amazon Acquires Facebook Satellite Internet Team,"


Amazon took another major step toward the completion of Project Kuiper, its effort to provide internet access via satellite, by acquiring a team of more than a dozen Facebook employees based in Los Angeles in April to work on the initiative.
Amazon paid Facebook an undisclosed amount as part of the deal, which now has the employees working on delivering internet connectivity from “low Earth orbit satellites,” according to a report by The Information confirmed by a Facebook spokesperson.
The transaction means Facebook is scrapping its plans to deliver internet connectivity to remote areas using its own satellites, an effort that started in 2018 as a way “to bring broadband connectivity to rural regions where internet connectivity is lacking or nonexistent.” Facebook had also tried to use internet drones to bring connectivity to remote areas, but ended that effort in 2018.
Amazon first started exploring satellite-based internet connectivity in 2019, with plans that include a US$10 billion investment that will launch 3,236 satellites into a low-earth orbit by 2029. The goal is the same as the one Facebook just scrapped: internet for “unserved and underserved communities around the world.”
Amazon estimates that it will be able to provide internet connectivity to 95% of the world’s population through this initiative. About four billion people worldwide don’t currently have reliable internet access 
The FCC approved Amazon’s network plan last year, and the company plans to launch half of its satellites by 2026. The company is building a lab in Redmond, Washington, according to The Information, and about 500 Amazon employees are working on Project Kuiper.

671,"May 11, 2021",German Watchdog Bans Facebook From Processing WhatsApp Data,"


Germany’s lead data protection regulator for Facebook is banning the social network from processing personal data from WhatsApp users because it views the messaging app’s new terms of use as illegal, reported The Economist.
The decision follows emergency proceedings opened by the regulator in the city-state of Hamburg last month after WhatsApp required users to consent to new terms or stop using the service. 
“This order seeks to secure the rights and freedoms of the many millions of users who give their consent to the terms of use throughout Germany,” Hamburg’s data protection officer Johannes Caspar said.
“My objective is to prevent disadvantages and damages associated with such a black-box procedure.”
Caspar, who leads domestic oversight of Facebook under Germany’s federal system as its country office is in Hamburg, announced his decision before a May 15 deadline for consenting.
WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, stated the action by the Hamburg data protection authority rested on a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose and effect of its update and therefore had no legitimate basis. 
“As the Hamburg DPA’s claims are wrong, the order will not impact the continued roll-out of the update. We remain fully committed to delivering secure and private communications for everyone,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said.

Israel’s Competition Authority announced on Tuesday, May 11, that it was considering imposing a fine of about 6 million shekels (US$1.8 million) on Facebook for buying two Israeli companies without the agency’s consent.
The authority stated it sent a hearing letter to Facebook after it found the social media giant purchased two Israeli companies, RedKix in 2018 and Service Friend in 2019, without approval and contrary to Israel’s Economic Competition Law.
“Facebook was obliged to report the transactions required the director general’s consent since Facebook is a ‘monopolist’, whose market share in Israel exceeds 50%,” the authority stated.
It stated the fine is subject to a hearing and Facebook has the right to submit its arguments to the authority’s director general within 60 days, reported CNBC.
Under the law, an entity which holds 50% or more in any relevant market is required to obtain the director general’s consent before making any transaction that constitutes a “merger of companies,” it noted.
The authority said Facebook, together with Instagram, is considered a monopoly in the market of social networks in Israel.

Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Tuesday, May 11, urged Facebook to reverse plans for a required update to its messaging platform subsidiary WhatsApp over concerns about data privacy, reported The Hill.
WhatsApp is issuing an update to its terms and services as it allows users to talk to businesses on the platform.
WhatsApp has stated that the update will not change its policies around keeping personal conversations encrypted, meaning Facebook and WhatsApp cannot read the messages.
But the Democrats wrote in a letter Tuesday that WhatsApp’s failure to commit to the same privacy policy for the messages with businesses is a “potential misuse of data,” and could lead to the use of that information for targeted advertising.
The key concern the lawmakers highlighted is the fact that “this policy may not provide an option to opt out.” 
After receiving a “persistent reminder” about the update, users will “encounter limited functionality on WhatsApp” until they accept the update, according to WhatsApp.
The Democrats underscored their request for the update to be reversed by noting that WhatsApp is a popular app used by immigrant communities in the US with ties abroad. 
“As Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, we are concerned that WhatsApp’s policy change may leave our immigrant communities vulnerable to further ad targeting. We believe consumers deserve the option to use WhatsApp knowing that their privacy will be protected the way the founders intended, and the way Facebook promised to uphold,” they wrote in the letter led by Rep. Lori Trahan (Democrat – Massachusetts).

675,"April 29, 2021",Australian Press Can Collectively Bargain With Google & Facebook Says Regulator,"


The ACCC has granted interim authorization for Country Press Australia (CPA) members to collectively negotiate with Facebook and Google over payments to publishers for their news content that appears on the platforms, reported the regulator. 
CPA is an industry body that represents the interests of independent regional and local newspapers throughout Australia. CPA currently represents 81 members and 160 regional newspapers, which provide local news to regional communities in print and online.
Authorisation will enable CPA members to collectively negotiate with each of Facebook and Google, engage in discussions with each other and exchange information about those negotiations. Without authorisation, these collective bargaining arrangements would risk breaching competition laws as no platforms have yet been ‘designated’ under the news bargaining code, which would automatically allow collective bargaining for news media businesses.
“The ACCC considers that allowing CPA members to bargain collectively is likely to result in public benefits by enhancing negotiations between regional publishers and digital platforms, and thereby assisting the sustainability of regional news production,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.
“These public benefits align with the purpose of the news media bargaining code, which was intended to allow and encourage collective bargaining.”
“We welcome the fact that both Facebook and Google appear to be successfully reaching voluntary deals with Australian news businesses, including a number of smaller publishers, following the passage of the bargaining code. The onus now remains on Facebook and Google to continue to negotiate in good faith with news businesses of all sizes,” Mr Sims said.

676,"April 29, 2021",Identifying the Market In the Facebook Antitrust Case,"
By: Herbert Hovenkamp (ProMarket)
In late 2020, the Federal Trade Commission brought an antitrust suit accusing Facebook of monopolization. Every antitrust case claiming an unlawful monopoly must identify a “market” that the defendant is monopolizing. Past defendants often produced a single, readily identifiable product such as aluminum ingot, cellophane, or Intel-based computer operating systems. Often, parties dispute the boundaries of these markets. For example, should the cellophane market be broadened to include wax paper and tin foil? Or should the operating system market in Microsoft be broadened to include Apple’s operating system?
Facebook has generated a different kind of dispute, however, which is that the grouping of products it offers is not a “market” at all. A fundamental proposition of economics since the nineteenth century is that markets are made up of close substitutes. Competition occurs inside a market because it defines the range of a customer’s choices. For example, we say that three gasoline stations in a two-block area are in the same market. Customers can choose among them, so they must compete for that customer’s business. A station fifty miles away is not in the same market if it is not a realistic option, nor is a grocer that is nearby but does not sell gasoline.
The FTC claims that Facebook monopolizes a market for “personal social networking services.” That includes services that are quite dissimilar, however. For example, Facebook offers general messaging, two-party chatting, posting of photographs and videos, discussion boards, a marketplace and digital advertising, and even a kind of dating platform. Facebook moved to dismiss the case by stating that the FTC “has not alleged a plausible relevant market.”  A similar issue is likely to arise in the Google antitrust case, as well as a potential future case against Amazon. To date, the lawsuits against Apple have focused mainly on its control of app sales through its Appstore.
So what binds Facebook’s diverse assembly of products into a “market”? Facebook’s individual services are clearly not close substitutes for one another. Further, many firms offer individual services that compete with one of Facebook’s services. For many of these, Facebook is not the biggest. For example, it is not the biggest messaging app, platform for hosting photos or videos, or even digital advertising platform. This is also true of Amazon, which has less-than-dominant market shares in most of the individual products that it sells, save ebooks….

677,"April 28, 2021",Facebook Appeals Giphy Merger Restrictions In The UK,"


On Wednesday Facebook argued to an appellate court that the UK’s antitrust enforcer cannot use interim measures during merger reviews to “regulate the structure of competition” across markets. Facebook is looking to challenge the restrictions imposed by the CMA while investigating its purchase of Giphy, saying the restraints are too broad.
Earlier this month Britain’s competition regulator said that it was referring Facebook’s acquisition of GIF database Giphy for an in-depth investigation.
The watchdog says it found evidence that Giphy had plans to expand its digital advertising partnerships to the UK and other markets before the deal was reached. It believes Giphy’s combination with Facebook would mean the firm has less incentive to expand its digital ads business, leading to a potential loss of competition.
“We will continue to fully cooperate with the CMA’s investigation,” a Facebook spokesperson told CNBC.
“This merger is good for competition and in the interests of everyone in the UK who uses GIPHY and our services — from developers to service providers to content creators,” the spokesperson added.
Giphy is one of the world’s top libraries for GIFs, animated images involving memes or pop culture references that are shared on the internet. It competes with the likes of Google-owned GIF platform Tenor and the start-up Gfycat.
Though both Giphy and Facebook are headquartered in the U.S., the CMA has the power to investigate mergers when the business being acquired has annual revenues of at least £70 million ($96.5 million) or when the combined businesses have at least a 25% share of any “reasonable” market.

678,"April 28, 2021",Facebook Says SCOTUS Ruling Means FTC Antitrust Suit Should Be Tossed,"
Facebook stated a US Supreme Court decision last week on the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) authority to recover money for consumers means the agency’s monopoly lawsuit against the company must be dismissed, reported Bloomberg.
Facebook argued in a court filing Tuesday, April 27, that the Supreme Court ruling bolsters its position that the FTC can’t pursue the antitrust lawsuit in federal court.
The FTC sued Facebook in December, accusing the social media company of abusing its dominance to thwart competition in violation of antitrust laws. The agency is asking for a court order requiring Facebook to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.
“The Supreme Court’s decision and its reasoning support Facebook’s argument that the FTC’s suit improperly circumvents limits on its authority,” Facebook stated in the filing in Washington federal court.
The Supreme Court’s unanimous decision was centered on a provision in federal law that the FTC has used to recover money for defrauded consumers. The agency claims the ruling puts at risk US$2.4 billion that the FTC is seeking to recover for consumers in 24 pending lawsuits.
Although the FTC’s case focuses on competition and does not seek monetary relief for consumers, the complaint relies on the same authority at issue in the Supreme Court decision, section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC also can sue companies in its in-house administrative court but chose to file the Facebook case in federal court where a group of states also sued the company.

Judge Beth Labson Freeman of the Northern District of California issued an order granting Facebook’s motion to dismiss with prejudice the antitrust lawsuit brought against it filed by three web developers – Reveal Chat Holdco, USA Technology and Management Services, and Beehive Biometric – finding the plaintiffs’ claims time-barred.
Previously, the plaintiffs sued Facebook in January 2020 for antitrust violations alleging that it shut out the competition. Specifically, Facebook was sued for “removing access to a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) in 2015 that Plaintiffs relied on for their mobile applications.” In June 2020, Facebook filed a reply to its motion to dismiss, after which, the court dismissed the suit with partial leave to amend. Facebook then moved to dismiss the first amended complaint, which the plaintiffs opposed.
Specifically, according to the order, the court previously found that the plaintiffs’ claims “were time-barred by the four-year statute of limitations for antitrust claims and that Plaintiffs had not adequately pled fraudulent concealment in part because they had not plausibly alleged they were without actual or constructive knowledge of the facts giving rise to their claims,” among other things, but granted them leave to amend for the issue of fraudulent concealment, which would toll the statute of limitations. Facebook filed another motion to dismiss the amended complaint, also asserting that the plaintiffs’ claims are time-barred.

680,"September 29, 2021",Google Tells EU Court New Updates Give Android A Chance Against Apple,"


Payments to phone makers to pre-install only Google Search on their devices were not aimed at preventing competition, but were necessary for Android to seize market share from Apple, Alphabet’s Google told Europe’s second-top court on Wednesday, September 29.
Google was addressing the General Court on the third day of a week-long hearing as it tries to get judges to dismiss a record €4.3 billion (US$3.7 billion) EU antitrust fine and a European Commission order to loosen its search engine grip on Android devices.
The EU competition watchdog had taken issue with two kinds of deals made with phone makers, one being payments for only pre-installing Google Search on their devices known as revenue sharing arrangements (RSAs) because these shut out rivals.
This was not the case and the payments were just to encourage phone makers, which were already generating money from other apps, to give Android a place, Google lawyer Assimakis Komninos told the court.
“Google had to offer an offsetting revenue stream. An incentive to convince them to open up and adopt the Android platform. At the same time, the RSAs also helped them to keep prices down and compete more successfully with Apple,” he said.
“And obviously, Google was getting in return a promotional opportunity, sole preinstallation, which allowed it to invest in a free OS (operating system), a free app store and so on.”
On top of that, the RSAs only covered 5% of the market, Komninos said.
Commission lawyer Nicholas Khan rejected the claim. “What concerned them was competitors gaining traction,” he said and the RDAs were “the pinnacle of Google’s interlocking practices.”

Sweeney took to Twitter on Wednesday, calling out Apple’s move and claiming that the company will continue to fight the tech giant.

The US tech giant is facing a raft of other legal and regulatory challenges to rules it forces game makers to follow, including the closely watched antitrust lawsuit brought by Epic Games.
Apple confirmed the authenticity of the letter that Sweeney shared, but declined to comment further. Apple has not yet stated whether it will ask for the injunction to be paused pending the appeal process.

682,"September 14, 2021","A Tying Perspective on Apple, the iPhone, and the App Store","
Significant attention has recently been paid to Apple’s behavior concerning the iPhone and App Store. In this paper, I employ economic theory concerning tying behavior to better understand the economic forces behind Apple’s behavior, and the extent to which intervention is justified. I identify three plausible motivations for Apple’s behavior – efficiency, price discrimination, and leveraging its market power – and discuss what each suggests concerning whether intervention is justified. The conclusion is that only the leverage argument provides a plausible rationale for intervention. In addition, this argument suggests that the case for intervention is stronger if Apple’ tying behavior concerning the iPhone and App Store significantly negatively affects the supply of apps.

By Michael Waldman1
 
I. INTRODUCTION
Apple’s behavior concerning the iPhone and the App Store has attracted significant antitrust scrutiny. This includes the recent Apple-Epic case, attention from both U.S. and European antitrust authorities, and scrutiny from the U.S. Congress which is considering updating U.S. antitrust laws. This raises a number of related questions. Is this attention justified? Is Apple violating the antitrust rules in either market? Should Apple be forced to change its behavior concerning the iPhone and the App Store?
In this paper, I shed light on these questions by discussing what the economic theory of tying tells us about Apple’s behavior. As I discuss in t...

683,"September 14, 2021",Apple Receives $6M From Fortnite Maker Following Court Order,"


Epic Games, the company behind the wildly popular Fortnite game, has paid Apple US$6 million for breaching the company’s App Store guidelines, according to a recent report from Apple Insider.
The payment resulted from a September 10 court ruling following a trial between the two companies, which began in May, as PYMNTS reported. Epic and Apple had battled over Apple’s App Store policies and the question of whether the larger company hampers its competition. Epic had initially indicated that it would appeal the ruling.

The fee paid to Apple represents damages stemming from funds generated by Fortnite sales on the App Store after Epic violated Apple’s policies and offered it elsewhere, according to the report.
Friday’s court ruling ordered Apple to loosen some of its rules concerning developers. However, the court found in favor of Apple in nine of 10 counts, allowing Apple to continue charging 15-30% for its in-app payment system.
In 2020, Epic implemented a direct payment option in its Fortnite game. In response, Apple eliminated Fortnite from the App Store.

684,"September 13, 2021",Apple Rejects Fortnite’s Bid For App Store Return In South Korea,"


Apple has rejected Epic Games’ plea to reinstate Fortnite in the App Store ahead of South Korea’s landmark law that grants app developers the right to offer their own payment methods, according to multiple media reports.
South Korea’s National Assembly passed an amendment to the Telecommunications Business Act, called the “Anti-Google law,” on August 31. It is expected to be signed by President Moon Jae-in and to go into effect on Wednesday, September 15. South Korea is the first country to legislate how Apple Pay and Google Pay payments are processed.
Epic was booted from the Apple App Store last August when the North Carolina game maker launched a payment platform to sidestep Apple’s payment system and 30% commission.
“We would welcome Epic’s return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else,” Apple said in a statement, adding that Epic admitted it had breached its contract, so reinstatement is not on the table at the moment.
Apple stated that even if South Korea’s amendment becomes law, Fortnite would still have to comply with the App Store’s review guidelines. Additionally, Apple stated it controls who is allowed into its App Store.
After being ousted from the Apple App Store last year, Epic launched a lawsuit accusing the iPhone maker of running a monopoly by controlling payments. The federal case in California is awaiting a verdict.

685,"September 12, 2021",Epic Games To Appeal Certain Parts Of Ruling In Apple Case,"


“Fortnite” game maker Epic Games on Sunday stated in a legal filing that it plans to appeal a ruling in its antitrust case against Apple after a federal judge on Friday, September 10, gave a mixed decision.
The judge on Friday said Apple would have to loosen some rules on developers. But the ruling favored Apple on many counts, including allowing the iPhone maker to continue its prohibition of third-party, in-app payment systems.
Epic had stated it would continue its legal fight.
The decision concludes the first part of the battle between the two companies over Apple’s App Store policies and whether they stifle competition. Apple won on 9 of 10 counts, but was found to engage in anticompetitive conduct under California law and will be forced to change its App Store policies and loosen its grip over in-app purchases. The injunction will come into effect in December.
“The Court concludes that Apple’s anti-steering provisions hide critical information from consumers and illegally stifle consumer choice,” Rogers wrote. “When coupled with Apple’s incipient antitrust violations, these anti-steering provisions are anticompetitive and a nationwide remedy to eliminate those provisions is warranted.”

However, Rogers said that Apple was not a monopolist and “success is not illegal.”
“Given the trial record, the Court cannot ultimately conclude that Apple is a monopolist under either federal or state antitrust laws,” Rogers wrote.

By Cat Zakrzewski,  Washington Post
For the second time in three months, a judge has determined that a major antitrust challenge against a tech giant failed to prove the company was maintaining an illegal monopoly.
From opposite sides of the country, two Obama-appointed judges, in separate decisions in separate cases, have undercut the mounting effort to rein in the power of Big Tech.
Northern California Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Friday ruled against the foundational argument of Epic Games’ high-profile antitrust lawsuit against Apple, determining that Epic had “overreached” in claiming that Apple had exercised monopoly control in its App Store.
Her ruling comes on the heels of D.C. Judge James E. Boasberg’s June decision to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit against Facebook, finding that the agency had failed to provide enough evidence to prove that Facebook had a monopoly in social networking.

687,"September 10, 2021",US Judge Rules Apple Can Not Force Developers To Use In-App Purchasing,"


Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers handed down a decision in a closely-watched trial between Apple and Epic Games on Friday, reported CNBC. 
Rogers issued an injunction that said that Apple will no longer be allowed to prohibit developers from providing links or other communications that direct users away from Apple in-app purchasing, of which it takes 15% to 30% of gross sales.
The injunction addresses a longstanding developer complaint and raises the possibility that developers could direct their users to their website to subscribe to or purchase digital content, hurting Apple’s App Store sales.
The decision concludes the first part of the battle between the two companies over Apple’s App Store policies and whether they stifle competition. Apple won on 9 of 10 counts but was found to engage in anticompetitive conduct under California law, and will be forced to change its App Store policies and loosen its grip over in-app purchases. The injunction will come into effect in December.

However, Rogers said that Apple was not a monopolist and “success is not illegal.”
“Given the trial record, the Court cannot ultimately conclude that Apple is a monopolist under either federal or state antitrust laws,” Rogers wrote.
The trial took place in Oakland, California in May, and included both company CEOs testifying in open court. People familiar with the trial previously told CNBC that both sides expected the decision to be appealed regardless of what it was.
“Today the Court has affirmed what we’ve known all along: the App Store is not in violation of antitrust law. As the Court recognized ‘success is not illegal,’” Apple said in a statement. ”’Apple faces rigorous competition in every segment in which we do business, and we believe customers and developers choose us because our products and services are the best in the world.”Read The Full Case Decision

Match Group on Friday filed a letter with Dutch competition authorities saying it believes the regulator has reached a decision in a complaint against Apple and asked for the decision to be made public, according to documents seen by Reuters.
Match Group, which owns the popular dating service Tinder, filed a complaint with the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) in 2020 alleging that Apple had violated Dutch antitrust laws by forcing Match to use Apple’s in-app payment systems and pay commissions to Apple.
In the letter filed on Friday, Match said it believes that enough time has passed that the Dutch regulator is legally required to have reached a decision. The company asked the regulator to adopt a decision and make it known to Match within two weeks.

Apple will let some apps like Netflix provide links to their websites for user payments, a small concession that would allow app developers to bypass the controversial 30% App Store fee the iPhone maker charges.
The concession was part of a settlement with Japan’s antitrust regulator, which said the change was enough for it to close a five-year investigation into Apple that focused on video and music apps but did not consider games.
The US tech giant, however, must still contend with a raft of other legal and regulatory challenges to rules it forces game makers to follow, including a closely watched antitrust lawsuit brought by “Fortnite” creator Epic Games.
The ban on providing separate links on App Store apps was lifted for so-called reader apps which provide content such as e-books, video and music that does not offer a free tier of service, instead requiring payment at sign-up.
Currently, apps like Netflix and Spotify skirt Apple’s commissions of around 15%-30% by forcing users to first sign up on their websites.
“Some of the biggest services in this ‘reader’ category are streamers like Netflix and Spotify which already have and rely on their own payment services,” PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore said.
“(The change) will allow smaller developers to manage a direct relationship with customers in order to manage their accounts and payment.”
The change is set to take effect early next year and will be applied globally, stated Apple, which will retain ultimate say over which apps qualify as reader apps.

690,"June 4, 2018",US: Microsoft snaps up GitHub for US$7.5b,"
Microsoft has reached an agreement to buy GitHub, the source repository and collaboration platform, in a deal worth US$7.5 billion. The all-stock deal is expected to close by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approval in the US and EU.
Decade-old GitHub is built on Git, the open source version control software originally written by Linux creator Linus Torvalds. Git is a distributed version control system: each developer has their own repository that they make changes to, and these changes can be propagated between repositories to share those changes.
“Microsoft is a developer-first company, and by joining forces with GitHub we strengthen our commitment to developer freedom, openness and innovation,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a release announcing the deal. “We recognize the community responsibility we take on with this agreement and will do our best work to empower every developer to build, innovate and solve the world’s most pressing challenges.”
Microsoft says the transaction, which must pass the usual regulatory scrutiny, will close by the end of 2018.

Speaking at Recode’s Code Conference in Palos Verdes, California, Microsoft President Brad Smith drew lessons from the software giant’s “gut wrenching” antitrust battles of the late 1990s that seem to resonate today, as Facebook faces scrutiny of its data privacy practices by regulators in the US and Europe.
“If you create technology that changes the world, the world is going to want to govern you, it’s going to want in some measure to regulate you,” Smith said on Wednesday, May 30, in the opening day of the Code Conference on Rancho Palos Verdes. “You have to come to terms with that.”
Microsoft was cast as a monopolist for its command of the software operating 90% of the world’s computer desktops in 1998, when antitrust regulators accused it of anticompetitive practices in its bundling of the Internet Explorer browser as part of its operating system, placing the rival Netscape browser at a disadvantage.
Now Microsoft finds itself at odds with the government again, though this time it’s over immigration policy. The software giant has joined many tech executives speaking out against President Donald Trump’s efforts to change immigration.

What the Microsoft Antitrust Case Taught Us

By Richard Blumenthal and Tim Wu
Twenty years ago today, Microsoft was sued by the Department of Justice and a coalition of 20 state attorneys general (including one of us, Mr. Blumenthal, of Connecticut) for violating federal antitrust law.
Microsoft, the world’s dominant software firm, and Bill Gates, the world’s richest man, faced a challenge from the upstart company Netscape and its internet browser, Netscape Navigator. The suit accused Microsoft of illegally protecting its operating-system monopoly and seeking a new monopoly for its own browser, Internet Explorer. The fear was that Microsoft would kill Netscape, monopolize the browser market and use that point of control to dominate the coming age of the web.
After a tough fight, the government won the case. There is now no browser monopoly, and the world has come to rely on the many apps, firms and ideas that were born after Microsoft’s control was broken. Microsoft has become a gentler giant, and Mr. Gates has become a philanthropist.

What Microsoft’s Antitrust Case Teaches Us About Silicon Valley
In the Twilight of the 20th century, Bill Gates was well and truly a tentacular squid, with his sucker-covered limbs extending into every level of the computer industry. The one area that Gates didn’t dominate: the World Wide Web. And how he tried to conquer that newfangled internet led to an epic court battle that continues to shape how the world sees the five-headed beast that Big Tech has become.
Microsoft famously missed the rise of the web in the early ’90s, with Gates dedicating only a fraction of his mid-’90s tome The Road Ahead to the internet. Meanwhile, Netscape introduced millions to the pleasures of browsing and surfing, forcing Microsoft to do one of its notorious “fast follows” (i.e., rapid copycat product launches). The company introduced Internet Explorer in 1995 and wasted no time in browbeating and cajoling companies the world over into making it the default web browser on their systems.

694,"January 30, 2018",US: Microsoft rumored to be looking at acquiring EA,"
An article published on January 29 on Polygon has garnered a lot of buzz online. While the piece, which speculates on the evolution of the Xbox One and Xbox brand, is well-worth a read in its entirety, of particular note is a paragraph that mentions the possibility of Microsoft acquiring Electronic Arts (EA), Valve, and PUBG Corp.
“The most recent one we heard (from a reliable source close to Microsoft) was, in fact, Electronic Arts,” the article reveals. “We also heard a whisper about Valve and about Korean outfit PUBG Corp., which Microsoft last year signed to a timed exclusive for its hit survival shooter, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds.”
The Xbox One has often been criticized for lacking in quality first-party video games so it does make sense that Microsoft would be considering purchasing additional game companies. EA is one of the biggest players in the video game industry right now though so acquiring it would be a massive game-changer. It would also be fairly expensive.

The lobbying group representing major internet players like Amazon, Netflix, and Google said it plans to join the legal battle over the Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC) move last month to repeal net neutrality.
The Internet Association (IA) said it would act as an “intervenor” in expected litigation over the FCC’s action. What that means is that the group wouldn’t be filing its own lawsuit, but would join a legal action filed by others. Public interest groups and some state attorneys general have said they intend to challenge the repeal in court.
“The final version of Chairman Pai’s rule, as expected, dismantles popular net neutrality protections for consumers,” Michael Beckerman, president and CEO of the Internet Association, said in a statement. “This rule defies the will of a bipartisan majority of Americans and fails to preserve a free and open internet. IA intends to act as an intervenor in judicial action against this order and, along with our member companies, will continue our push to restore strong, enforceable net neutrality protections through a legislative solution.”
The FCC, in a 3-2 party-line vote, repealed rules that ban internet providers from blocking or throttling content, or from creating “fast lanes” that would be for sale to sites that want speedier access to consumers. They left in place rules that require that ISPs disclose how they handle internet traffic.
The FCC posted the final text version of its action earlier this week, and it is expected to enter the Federal Register in the coming weeks.

The Commission unconditionally clears the acquisition of GitHub by Microsoft By Anna Renata Pisarkiewicz (European University Institute)1
The Facts of the Microsoft/GitHub Acquisition
On September 14, 2018, Microsoft and GitHub notified the European Commission about their intention to merge. Both parties to the transaction supply various software development and operations (“DevOps”) tools that individuals and organizations use when developing and releasing software. GitHub, in particular, supplies the popular code hosting platform for version control and collaboration on software development, which can be used online (GitHub.com), and on-premises (GitHub Enterprise). At the time of the notification, with more than 28 million developers in its community, and 85 million code repositories, GitHub was the largest host of source code globally.2
Given that the EU turnover of GitHub was less than EUR 250 million in the last financial year for which data was available at the time of the notification, the transaction did not have a Union dimension under Article 1(2) or Article 1(3) of the Merger Regulation. However, it did have such a dimension pursuant to Article 4(5), as it was capable of being reviewed under the national competition laws of four Member States, namely Austria, Cyprus, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Having reviewed the transaction, the Commission approved it ...

With Broadcom’s Qualcomm buyout offer, Microsoft and Google have expressed private concerns over the potential purchase. That is, at least according to sources close to the matter. Both companies — along with other unnamed tech companies – have expressed several concerns.
The first concern is the possible influence Apple may have over the deal. The second concern revolves around Broadcom’s reputation for cutting costs over investing in upcoming technology. So far, a Qualcomm buyout hasn’t come to fruition as Qualcomm hopes to get more out of Broadcom.
Qualcomm has recently rejected Broadcom’s offers. The company has since nominated a new board of directors earlier this week. Broadcom has even considered boosting its offer. Though, the Snapdragon chip maker has expressed antitrust concerns. Even so, Qualcomm has asked Google and Microsoft — among other tech companies — to keep their concerns private.
Of course, there’s a possibility that Apple will benefit greatly from the Qualcomm buyout. Qualcomm currently provides chips for both the iPhone and iPad. Though, legal battles between Qualcomm and the Cupertino company have strained the relationship. Broadcom chief Hock Tan has expressed a positive outlook moving forward if his company buys Qualcomm.

Google has filed a lawsuit against South Korea’s antitrust regulator to overturn the regulator’s decision to penalise the global technology giant for pressing smartphone makers into only using its Android mobile operating system, reported the Korean Herald.
The legal action by Google against the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) came after the KFTC decided in September last year to fine Google 207.4 billion won ($173 million) for obstructing local smartphone makers, such as Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, from using operating systems developed by rivals.
According to the sources, the suit was filed on Jan. 24 in an attempt to annul the KFTC’s decision to impose the fine and order Google LLC, Google Asia Pacific and Google Korea to take corrective steps to ban its practice of forcing local smartphone makers not to use operating systems developed by rivals.
The KFTC said Google has hampered market competition by requiring smartphone makers to enter into an “anti-fragmentation agreement (AFA)” when they sign key contracts with Google over app store licenses and early access to OS.

Google Analytics, the world’s most widely used web analytics service developed by Alphabet’s Google, risks giving US intelligence services access to French website users’ data, France’s watchdog CNIL said on Thursday.
In a decision targeting an unnamed French website manager, the data privacy regulator — one of the most vocal and influential in Europe — said the US tech giant hadn’t taken sufficient measures to guarantee data privacy rights under European Union regulation when data was transferred between Europe and the United States.“These (measures) are not sufficient to exclude the accessibility of this data to US intelligence services,” the regulator said in a statement.
“There is therefore a risk for French website users who use this service and whose data is exported.”
The CNIL said that the French website manager in question had one month to comply with EU regulation and that it had issued similar orders to other website operators.The CNIL’s decision follows a similar one by its Austrian counterpart, coming after complaints by Vienna-based noyb (Non Of Your Business), an advocacy group founded by Austrian lawyer and privacy activist Max Schrems who won a high profile case with Europe’s top court in 2020.

Google faces a fine after Russia’s antitrust watchdog said the US tech firm had breached rules related to suspending and blocking accounts on its YouTube video service, reported Reuters. 
Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) said on Thursday the fine would be determined during an administrative investigation, adding Google’s conduct had infringed users’ interests and restricted competition.
“Google is waiting for the full text of the decision in order to examine it,” the company, a unit of Alphabet, said. Russia has handed Google several small fines in the last year for failing to delete content Moscow deems illegal, part of a wider campaign critics characterize as an attempt by the Russian authorities to exert tighter control over the internet.
Related: Russia Fines Google Again And Threatens Mega Fine In Future
It upped the ante in December by imposing a 7.2 billion roubles ($97 million) penalty for what it said was a persistent failure to remove banned items. Google has appealed that ruling.
“(The FAS) found that the rules related to creating, suspending and blocking accounts and handling of user content on YouTube were non-transparent, biased and unpredictable,” the FAS said in a statement.
YouTube was also the subject of a protracted dispute with Tsargrad TV, a Christian Orthodox channel, which Google blocked as the account was owned by a Russian businessman targeted by U.S. sanctions.
According to Reuters, Konstantin Malofeev claimed victory in that case in December, saying Google faced a potentially heavy fine. YouTube also drew Moscow’s ire for taking down a live stream of Russian broadcaster RT DE last year, part of a wider spat that saw Russia shut down German broadcaster Deutsche Welle’s operations in Moscow earlier this month and strip its staff of their accreditation

Which is the understanding that controlling what is, in-effect, the next-generation operating system, will deliver an incredibly powerful gatekeeper role that will allow the extraction of huge rents. There is particular scope for harm to potential competition from self-preferencing by these gatekeepers. This short paper sets out the exclusionary concerns and distinguishes those from exploitative concerns that I argue may nevertheless distort and restrict competition by creating a hold-up problem. I explore how these concerns might apply in the Metaverse and other emerging technologies, and argue that applying the type of self-preferencing and interoperability rules that are currently under consideration to these emerging markets will protect potential competition, provide helpful certainty for investors, and help to build an innovative but more decentralized next generation of technologies.

704,"February 9, 2022","Facebook Hit Hard By New Rules, Google Spared","


Facebook’s owner is alleging Google, which also sells personalized ads on iPhones, has an unfair advantage under Apple’s new policies, reported Bloomberg.
Apps including Facebook have to ask users if they consent to being tracked, but Google’s search results and browser don’t — causing some advertisers’ budgets to shift to Google for more effective targeting.
Meta only started critiquing other tech giants by name in recent years. The social media behemoth, now facing antitrust scrutiny around the world, stands to benefit from framing itself as an underdog, threatened by larger forces.
Still, Meta told investors it expected to miss out on $10 billion in ad revenue in 2022 because of Apple’s changes, making it clear the company is more severely impacted than others. Facebook had relied on data from other apps and websites to make its ads effective. Without it, advertisers need to spend more money to achieve the same results.
Facebook ads are “still important, just costing a heck of a lot more,” said Doug Zarkin, chief marketing officer of Pearle Vision, which relies on Facebook and Instagram to drive people to its eye-care website and stores. He estimated that campaigns are 15% to 30% more expensive than last year.
Last year, Google said it wouldn’t prompt consumers about data collection because, after Apple’s change, it decided not to use any of the data on iPhones that would require permission.
According to Bloomberg, Google also doesn’t need the kind of data Facebook does from third parties in order to make its ads work. It runs its own mobile operating system, Android, and its own ad exchanges.
“Google just happens to be in the right place at the right time,” said Rick Watson, chief executive of RMW Consulting. “They were the biggest recipient of the ad dollars that were shifted because of effectiveness.”

A Swedish price comparison website is suing Google for 2.1 billion euros over allegations that it manipulated search results in favor of its own competing shopping service, reported Reuters.
PriceRunner said Monday that it plans to take Google to court in Stockholm. It’s seeking compensation for damages in relation to a 2017 ruling from the European Commission that Google breached antitrust laws by giving preference to its own shopping comparison product, Google Shopping, through its popular search engine.
After a seven-year investigation into the practices, the EU executive body dealt Google a historic $2.7 billion fine. Google appealed the penalty, but in November 2021, the decision was upheld by the EU’s General Court. The verdict can still be appealed and taken to the EU’s highest court.

PriceRunner CEO Mikael Lindahl said the company launched its lawsuit following “extensive and thorough preparations.”
“We are of course seeking compensation for the damage Google has caused us during many years, but are also seeing this lawsuit as a fight for consumers who have suffered tremendously from Google’s infringement of the competition law for the past fourteen years and still today,” Lindahl said in a statement.
“This is also a matter of survival for many European entrepreneurial companies and job opportunities within tech.”

706,"February 6, 2022",Google May Be Luckier on Media Competition Bill Than on App Store Bill,"


By PYMNTS
Google just completed a week with more news headlines than it probably wanted. Some of them were very positive, like earnings in the last quarter going up 32% year-over-year. Some of them were less positive, like the approval by the Senate Panel of the Open App Market Act that will now pass to the Senate floor for a vote. 
Then, there was another legislative development whose fate is still unknown, but from which Google may still escape unscathed. On Wednesday, the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust and Consumer Rights held a hearing to debate the benefits and risks of the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act (JCPA). 
This bill, introduced in both chambers last year, essentially establishes a temporary four-year antitrust immunity for news outlets to come together and negotiate collectively with Google and Meta. 
By enabling news outlets and publishers to collectively negotiate with the tech giants, including small companies that otherwise wouldn’t have any bargaining power, they could increase their revenues and guarantee the continuation of high-quality journalism and local news.

707,"February 3, 2022",Google Says Plaintiffs Are Asking For “Irrelevant” Docs In Antitrust Case,"


Google’s lawyers argued in a filing in Manhattan federal court that the plaintiffs have asked for “irrelevant” records outside the scope of court orders in the advertising multidistrict litigation and that the company has already turned over about 850,000 documents, reported Reuters.
The filing from Google’s attorneys at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer was a response to assertions on Monday, January 31, in a filing from the plaintiffs’ lawyers accusing Google of “gamesmanship and delay.”
The plaintiffs contend Google has not provided all the documents that the company, in related litigation, gave to a group of states, including Texas, that sued in 2020 over alleged antitrust violations concerning advertising technology, widely known as “ad tech.”
A lawyer for the advertiser class, Jordan Elias of San Francisco’s Girard Sharp, told Reuters on Thursday that “there is no burden to Google from giving private plaintiffs access to the documents it previously produced to government enforcers.”
The plaintiffs’ attorneys said in their filing that court orders “did not permit Google to comb over and reexamine its production to the state of Texas to decide for itself what was and was not ‘related to ad tech.'”

708,"February 1, 2022","80% Of App Developers Support Bill To Rein In Google, Apple: Poll","


84% of app developers support an antitrust bill aimed at curtailing the market power of Apple’s and Google’s app stores, according to a poll from the Coalition for App Fairness released Monday, January 31.
The industry group for app developers is pushing Congress to pass the Open App Markets Act, a bipartisan Senate bill that would block app stores from favoring their own in-house apps in searches, requiring developers to use their payment systems and preventing users from downloading apps from third-party stores.  
Developers surveyed by the group complained about exorbitant fees charged by the largest app stores — Apple charges a 30% commission on app store sales for large developers — and expressed how they’d experienced difficulty getting their apps featured or accepted by app stores. Just 13% of app developers surveyed oppose the bill.
“The evidence is clear – app developers want the Open App Markets Act to pass so that they can have the opportunity to compete in a fair digital marketplace,” Meghan DiMuzio, executive director of the Coalition for App Fairness, said in a statement.
“For too long, developers have been harmed by gatekeepers’ monopolistic practices, and consumers have suffered from less choice and innovation.”

709,"January 31, 2022",Senator Lee To Introduce Bill To Break Google’s Hold On Advertising,"


Lawmakers from both parties are set to introduce bills that could break Google’s stranglehold on the advertising business and start to chip away at Big Tech monopolies, The Post has learned.
Senator Mike Lee (Republican – Utah) is set to introduce a bill within weeks that would bar Google and other large tech firms from controlling multiple parts of the online ad supply chain.
According to The New York Post, while Lee’s bill appears to be aimed squarely at Google, it could also affect Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta, which makes the bulk of its revenue from advertising. 
The bill would put an end to a company’s ability to act as a broker for a buyer or seller of ad space while simultaneously owning the exchange where ad space is traded, a source with knowledge of the proposed legislation said. Passage of the bill would represent a potentially multibillion-dollar blow to Google’s current model, which critics say allows the tech giant to charge unfairly high commissions.
Critics say that Google often plays the roles of buyer, seller, and middleman in the online ad market — a position that one of the tech giant’s own employees compared to Goldman Sachs owning the New York Stock Exchange, according to an ongoing lawsuit from Texas and 14 other states.
“A $100,000 stock trade will cost you a few dollars in exchange fees paid to the NYSE,” Notre Dame antitrust law professor Roger P. Alford said during a Senate hearing last month. “But a $100,000 ad campaign will cost you $20,000 in fees paid to Google’s exchange.” 
Senator Lee’s bill would also give Google a fiduciary duty to its advertising clients, similarly to how a financial adviser is legally required to act for the sole benefit of their clients.

710,"July 12, 2021","FTC Could Take Months To Rule On Amazon, MGM Deal","


Amazon’s US$8.5 billion deal to buy MGM might not be decided for several months with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Reuters writes.
The FTC stated as of last Friday, July 9, that it would be going ahead with a second request in its review of the merger. This, according to the report, indicates that the agency is likely to take months to come to a ruling.
The FTC is looking into Amazon as part of a number of probes into various Big Tech-related issues.
Amazon announced its intent in May to buy the legendary movie studio, which has been home to films such as the James Bond franchise. The deal would propel Amazon’s library of content to new heights and will allow it to continue competing with fellow giants Netflix, Disney+, and others.
In June, Amazon requested that Lina Khan, the FTC chair, be recused from the hearing, as she’d done research and had previous advocacy records.
PYMNTS has written about Amazon’s intent to buy MGM, reporting that it’s the newest in a series of moves to bolster the non-core part of the business: content for Amazon Prime.
“MGM has nearly a century of filmmaking history and complements the work of Amazon Studios, which has primarily focused on producing TV show programming,” a joint statement said, according to PYMNTS.
MGM’s acquisition, the latest in a string of tie-ups for the company, marks the passing of the company from a silent film-era giant into the streaming age currently dominating things.
Amazon had announced its intent to help archive and preserve the MGM film library, which contains over 4,000 films and 17,000 TV shows. And it’ll also work on making them available for viewing in modern ways. Mike Hopkins, senior VP of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, said “the treasure trove of IP that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM’s talented team” will be the most important thing gained in the transaction.

711,"July 6, 2021",Pentagon Cancels $10B JEDI Contract Over Amazon & Microsoft Complaints,"
The US Department of Defense announced it’s calling off the US$10 billion cloud contract that was the subject of a legal battle involving Amazon and Microsoft. But it’s also announcing a new contract and soliciting proposals from both cloud service providers where both will likely clinch a reward.
The JEDI, or Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, deal has become one of the most tangled contracts for the Department of Defense. In a press release Tuesday, the Pentagon said that “due to evolving requirements, increased cloud conversancy, and industry advances, the JEDI Cloud contract no longer meets its needs.”
Shares of Microsoft were down about 0.4% following the news and Amazon shares were up 3.5% after already reaching a 52-week high.
The fight over a cloud computing project does not appear to be completely over yet. The Pentagon stated in the press release that it still needs enterprise-scale cloud capability and announced a new multi-vendor contract known as the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability.
The agency stated it plans to solicit proposals from both Amazon and Microsoft for the contract, adding that they are the only cloud service providers that can meet its needs. But, it added, it will continue to do market research to see if others could also meet its specifications.
The lucrative JEDI contract was intended to modernize the Pentagon’s IT operations for services rendered over as many as 10 years. Microsoft was awarded the cloud computing contract in 2019, beating out market leader Amazon Web Services.
A month later, Amazon’s cloud computing unit, AWS, filed a lawsuit in the US Court of Federal Claims protesting the JEDI decision.

712,"July 5, 2021",Jeff Bezos Steps Down As Amazon CEO ,"


Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stepped down as CEO on Monday, July 5, handing over the reins as the company navigates the challenges of a world fighting to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic.
Andy Jassy, who ran Amazon’s cloud-computing business, replaced Bezos, a change the company announced in February.
Bezos, Amazon’s biggest shareholder with a stake worth about US$180 billion, will still hold sway over the company he started out of his Seattle garage in 1995. He takes over the role of executive chair, with plans to focus on new products and initiatives.
Jassy takes the helm of a US$1.7 trillion company that benefited greatly from the pandemic, more than tripling its profits in the first quarter of 2021 and posting record revenue as customers grew ever more dependent on online shopping.
At the same time, Amazon faces activism from a restive workforce just as a rapid economic recovery causes a labor crunch that has retailers, manufacturers, and other companies competing for workers with higher wages and other benefits.

“(Restrictions) would affect the retail sale of Apple products by third parties and the advertising of competing Apple products, leading to a reduced competition in the Internet retail market for electronic products,” the CNMC stated.

714,"June 30, 2021",Amazon Wants FTC Chair Lina Khan Recused In Antitrust Probes,"


On Wednesday, June 30, Amazon filed a motion seeking to recuse Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairwoman Lina Khan from antitrust investigations into the company, reported CNBC.
Amazon spokesperson Jack Evans told CNBC in a statement, “While we have the utmost respect for FTC Chair Khan, her work for the Open Markets Institute (a longtime Amazon critic), law journal articles, and role as a chief author of the House Judiciary Committee Antitrust Subcommittee report all reflect preconceived views about the company that she has repeatedly confirmed in media interviews. Amazon should be scrutinized along with all large organizations. However, even large companies have the right to an impartial investigation. Chair Khan’s body of work and public statements demonstrate that she has prejudged the outcome of matters the FTC may examine during her term and, under established law, preclude her from participating in such matters.”
Earlier this month, Khan was sworn in as chair of the FTC. The surprise move came just hours after she was confirmed by the Senate to serve as a commissioner.
Khan made her first big splash in antitrust circles with her 2017 Yale Law Journal article, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” The article, which she wrote while still a law student, argued that the popular antitrust framework focused on consumer welfare, was inadequate to assess digital giants like Amazon.

715,"June 30, 2021",Elizabeth Warren Calls For “Meticulous Antitrust Scrutiny” Amazon-MGM Deal,"


In a letter sent to Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan, Sen. Elizabeth Warren asserted that Amazon’s billion-dollar bid for MGM might harm consumers and extend Amazon’s market dominance beyond an acceptable level.
The letter, first published in The Verge, outlined the senator’s concerns about the online retail giant’s power in streaming and entertainment services with Prime Video in addition to its market dominance in other online areas and overall competitive voraciousness. 
“Amazon’s massive presence in a host of retailing businesses creates conflicts of interest throughout its online marketplace ecosystem that may provide it with the incentive and ability to harm competitors in unexpected ways that a narrowly-focused antitrust analysis may not anticipate or reveal,” Warren wrote in the letter dated June 29.
“Therefore, the FTC should look beyond streaming and entertainment services and assess the possible competitive effects on customers, sellers, and workers across all of Amazon’s retailing segments when reviewing this transaction.”
Amazon has a limited footprint in the film industry, but it will have a number of advantages as it enters the market.
The company’s deep pockets put the company in a virtually unmatched position to invest heavily to strengthen its position in the streaming wars. Moreover, Prime Video is offered as one of many services that are technically “perks” rather than individual paid subscriptions. New offerings like exclusive content serve to boost the appeal of Amazon’s paid Prime subscription service, which costs US$119 per year.
Amazon announced in May that it had reached a deal to acquire the legacy film studio for US$8.45 billion. At the time, SVP of Prime Video and Amazon Studios Mike Hopkins said that Amazon was drawn to MGM because of “the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM’s talented team.”

Amazon said Friday it was acquiring the encrypted messaging app Wickr which offers secure communications for businesses, government agencies and individuals.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Amazon said in a statement it would incorporate Wickr in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division which offers cloud computing and other services.
AWS will continue to offer Wickr services including end-to-end encrypted communications which meet certain regulatory requirements.
“The need for this type of secure communications is accelerating,” said AWS vice president Stephen Schmidt
“With the move to hybrid work environments, due in part to the Covid-19 pandemic, enterprises and government agencies have a growing desire to protect their communications across many remote locations.”
Wickr has touted its “military grade” encryption for business and government users, and was among the apps reportedly used to leak information from the White House during the Trump administration.

717,"June 25, 2021",Amazon & Google Investigated By UK Regulator Over Fake Reviews,"


Amazon and Google are to be investigated by the UK competition watchdog over concerns the tech companies have not done enough to tackle the widespread problem of fake reviews on their websites.
The Competition and Markets Authority, which began looking at the issue of fake reviews on major platforms two years ago, will now consider whether Amazon and Google have broken consumer law by not taking sufficient action to protect shoppers from fake reviews.
Sellers use fake and misleading reviews to improve their star ratings, which can in turn affect how prominently their company, and products, are displayed when consumers shop online.
“Our worry is that millions of online shoppers could be misled by reading fake reviews and then spending their money based on those recommendations,” said Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA. “Equally, it’s simply not fair if some businesses can fake five-star reviews to give their products or services the most prominence while law-abiding businesses lose out.”
The CMA said its work so far raised “specific concerns” that the two Silicon Valley companies were not doing enough to detect fake and misleading reviews or suspicious patterns of behavior and investigate those reviews, and were failing to impose adequate sanctions on reviewers or businesses who break the rules on posts – even the serial offenders.
It was also concerned that Amazon’s systems have been failing to “adequately protect and deter” some sellers from manipulating product listings – for example, by co-opting positive reviews from other products.
If the CMA’s investigation finds Amazon and Google have broken consumer law it could take enforcement action. This could include securing formal commitments from Amazon and Google to crack down on the problem, or pursuing court action if they fail to do so.

The chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights called on Amazon and Google’s Alphabet to extend more information about how smart home devices and virtual assistants will meet user privacy and competition requirements.
A subcommittee hearing last week, Protecting Innovation and Consumer Choice in Home Technologies, raised issues about dominance and competition in the smart home sector.
US Senator Amy Klobuchar (Democrat – Minnesota) sent a letter to Alphabet and Amazon asking both to respond by July 2 regarding how data is collected and used. The letter was sent to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.
“I am deeply concerned about competition and the future of innovation related to connected home devices … The hearing testimony raised profound concerns about the ways your companies may use that power to suppress competition in the emerging connected home technology industry, as well as your access to and use of highly sensitive personal information,” Klobuchar wrote in the letter, which was dated Tuesday, June 22.
“More than 94 million Americans already have connected speakers. And we are just at the beginning; these connected home technologies will continue to develop and expand beyond lighting and thermostats to appliances like connected refrigerators and washing machines. In the years to come, they will play an even larger role in our everyday lives,” Klobuchar wrote.
The subcommittee chair also asked specifically about supported devices regarding Matter, a new smart home interoperability standard jointly developed by tech industry leaders like Apple, Google, Amazon, and others.
Connected smart home devices took off during the pandemic as people hunkered down at home. A survey conducted by Security.org in October 2020 showed that 91% of respondents already had at least one smart home device. Some 64% indicated they were planning to acquire that technology in 2021.

719,"June 22, 2021","Google, Amazon Speak Against New Antitrust Bills ","


Amazon and Google both released statements on Tuesday, June 22, opposing the new antitrust bills that have been introduced. Apple and Facebook, which were also targets of the House Judiciary Committee’s investigation into digital markets, have yet to put out their own statements. 
However, industry groups backed by the tech firms have also pushed back on the legislation, arguing it would prevent the companies from operating popular consumer services and ultimately hurt small businesses and entrepreneurs.
The six bills set to be considered at Wednesday’s markup, where lawmakers will discuss the proposals and any amendments before deciding whether they should advance, would have a profound impact on the tech industry and possibly beyond it. 
Amazon and Google both called for the Judiciary Committee to pump the breaks on the legislation, which is headed to a full committee markup in an unusually short period of time — less than two weeks since most were introduced.
Google VP of Government Affairs and Public Policy Mark Isakowitz said in a statement the company isn’t opposed to new regulation, but warned the bills on the table would “break” popular consumer services.
“As many groups and companies have observed, the bills would require us to degrade our services and prevent us from offering important features used by hundreds of millions of Americans,” he said. “This would all dramatically undermine US technology leadership, damage the way small businesses connect with consumers, and raise serious privacy and security concerns. We respectfully recommend that these consequences receive more thoughtful consideration before Congress takes action.”
Amazon VP of Public Policy Brian Huseman also warned of “significant negative effects” on Amazon consumers and small- and medium-sized businesses that sell on the platform. Amazon is still reviewing the bills, he added.
“More than a half million American small- and medium-sized businesses make a living via Amazon’s marketplace, and without access to Amazon’s customers, it will be much harder for these third-party sellers to create awareness for their business and earn a comparable income,” he said in a statement. “Removing the selection of these sellers from Amazon’s store would also create less price competition for products, and likely end up increasing prices for consumers. The Committee is moving unnecessarily fast in pushing these bills forward. We encourage Chairman Cicilline and committee members to slow down, postpone the markup, and thoroughly vet the language in the bills for unintended negative consequences.”

The Delhi High Court on Thursday, April 22, rejected a plea by WhatsApp and Facebook to overturn an order by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to investigate allegations of abuse of dominance against the messaging platform’s new privacy policy. 
The big tech giant and its sister messaging company had earlier petitioned the SC to block the probe as several cases related to the privacy policy were pending before the higher courts. However, Justice Navin Chawla reportedly said that this rationale doesn’t hold and the competition watchdog cannot be bound by the outcome of those cases to commence its own investigation.
According to a Bar and Bench report, senior counsel Harish Salve, representing WhatsApp in a hearing on April 13, had said that the matter is already pending before the Supreme Court and the investigation taken up by CCI is just a “headline-grabbing endeavour.” He added that WhatsApp cannot “see” any user conversations and all the conversations are protected by end-to-end encryption. Besides this, all the messages are deleted from the company’s servers after they are delivered.
In its March order to complete the investigation within 60 days, the competition regulator had stated that the new privacy policy is “exclusionary and exploitative” and it would enable WhatsApp to abuse its dominant position in India.

A group of Wisconsin newspapers have filed a federal lawsuit claiming Google and Facebook’s monopoly on digital advertising threatens the publications’ existence and violates antitrust law.
The lawsuit claims the internet giants’ monopoly threatens the existence of local newspapers nationwide as well as a “profoundly negative effect on American democracy and the civic life,” the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Tuesday, April 20. Google unlawfully exercised monopoly power over the digital advertising market and illegally conspired with Facebook to engage in anti-competitive conduct, according to the filing.
The two dozen newspapers include the Tomahawk Leader, Antigo Times, and the Kewaskum Statesman.
The lawsuit is one of about a dozen similar complaints filed by newspaper publishers across the country, Michael Fuller Jr., an attorney leading the Wisconsin publications’ lawsuit, told the Journal Sentinel. He said he expects the lawsuits will be consolidated before a single federal judge and could attract larger newspaper chains as additional plaintiffs.
The lawsuits come as newspapers across the country have lost ad revenue as advertising has shifted online to search and social media. According to the Wisconsin filing, nearly 1,800 US newspapers have closed or merged since 2014, leaving about 200 counties without a newspaper.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and a large group of US states asked a federal court on Wednesday, April 14, to deny Facebook’s request to dismiss major antitrust lawsuits filed against the social media giant in December.
According to Reuters, the FTC, in its filing, wrote that Facebook bought photo-sharing app Instagram because CEOe Mark Zuckerberg believed it was “a large and viable competitor” and purchased the messaging app WhatsApp to neutralize a nascent threat. The FTC has asked the court to order Facebook to sell those assets.
The states, which had filed a separate antitrust lawsuit against Facebook, wrote in their filing, “Deploying a buy-or-bury scheme of predatory acquisitions and exclusionary conduct, Facebook successfully squashes, suppresses, and deters competition, entrenching its monopoly power to this day.”
Facebook had asked the court to dismiss the two lawsuits, alleging that they were brought “in the fraught environment of relentless criticism of Facebook for matters entirely unrelated to antitrust concerns.”
It also stated that the states, in their case, failed to show that they were harmed by Facebook and that they waited too long.
The FTC and states accused Facebook of breaking antitrust law to keep smaller competitors at bay and snapping up rivals, like Instagram for US$1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 for US$19 billion.

The new digital regulator must have tough legal powers to force tech giants like Google and Facebook to pay news organizations fairly for content, the UK’s competition watchdog stated on Tuesday, April 13.
Daniel Gordon, from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), told peers that a planned code of conduct for online platforms was “necessary” to protect the interests of newspapers, websites and advertisers due to Google and Facebook’s online dominance. 
Facing the Lords’ Communications and Digital Committee in the afternoon, he said that the UK needed a beefed-up version of a code introduced in Australia earlier this year, and could also look at examples from other countries including Germany.
A code of conduct introduced Down Under sparked a furious row as Facebook cut access to websites including MailOnline rather than pay fairly for content. 
It prompted accusations of bullying before the Australian government backed down and softened the law. 
The UK’s new regulator, the Digital Markets Unit, is expected to get legal power to suspend, block, or reverse anti-competitive action by tech giants in a bid to create a level playing field for news publishers and other digital businesses.

Facebook has removed 16,000 groups that traded fake product reviews on its platforms as the UK’s competition regulator uncovered more evidence of misleading content, reported Yahoo.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated it was the second time it had taken action against Facebook. In January last year, Facebook, along with online selling firm eBay, committed to better identifying, investigating, and removing groups and other pages, as well as preventing them from reappearing.
Facebook gave a similar pledge in relation to its Instagram business in May 2020, after the CMA had identified similar concerns.
However, the watchdog was forced to intervene for a second time after a follow-up investigation found evidence that the illegal trade in fake reviews was still taking place on both Facebook and Instagram.
The tech giant is set to make it harder for people to find groups and profiles that buy and sell fake reviews.
Further changes to its systems include suspending or banning users who are repeatedly creating Facebook groups and Instagram profiles that promote, encourage, or facilitate fake and misleading reviews.
Other changes include introducing new automated processes that will improve the detection and removal of this content, and making it harder for people to use Facebook’s search tools to find fake and misleading review groups and profiles on Facebook and Instagram.

726,"April 8, 2021",FTC Hits Back At Facebook Calling It “Personal Social Networking” Monopoly,"


The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ratcheted up the rhetoric in its lawsuit against Facebook in a filing late Wednesday, April 7, calling it a “personal social networking” monopoly that is “violating the antitrust laws by maintaining its monopoly through means other than competition on the merits.”
In urging the judge handling the agency’s antitrust lawsuit against the social networking giant to proceed despite Facebook’s request last month to dismiss it, the FTC argued Facebook is trying to get the fight thrown out “before it even begins.”
“Congress has explicitly provided that the FTC need not challenge an acquisition at its first opportunity to do so,” the FTC stated in a filing in Washington federal court. “Instead, the FTC can challenge an acquisition at any time, under any provision of law.”
According to Yahoo, Facebook’s “repeated observation” that the agency could have challenged the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp several years ago is irrelevant, the filing stated.
The legal broadside was in a response to a Facebook motion in March that dismissed antitrust lawsuits by the FTC and state attorneys general last year as “misguided.”
“These complaints do not credibly claim that our conduct harmed either” competition or consumers, Facebook then argued.
The FTC’s lawsuit is seeking to force Facebook to peel off acquisitions Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook also faces a lawsuit from dozens of attorneys general who claim it violated antitrust law by scooping up competitors.

WhatsApp and Facebook have both petitioned the Delhi High Court to dismiss the Competition Commission Of India (CCI) order that had called for an investigation into WhatsApp’s privacy policy update. The competition watchdog stated on March 24 that the probe had to be completed in 60 days.
The petitions, seen and reviewed by Inc42, although filed separately by Facebook and WhatsApp, are broadly similar. Both companies contend that cases regarding the privacy policy update are already being heard in the Supreme Court and the CCI should be restrained from any probe until those cases are resolved. 
Interestingly, Facebook claimed that it shouldn’t be investigated since its social media business and the WhatsApp messaging platform are different entities. But at the same time, it also asserted that the competition watchdog should present evidence of WhatsApp’s dominance before being allowed to investigate.
“Today’s consumers value non-price parameters of services viz. quality, customer service, innovation, etc. as equally if not more important as price. The competitors in the market also compete on the basis of such non-price parameters. Reduction in consumer data protection and loss of control over their personalised data by the users can be taken as reduction in quality under the antitrust law,” stated the CCI order in late March.

Facebook’s acquisition of customer service startup Kustomer may be subjected to European Union antitrust scrutiny after Austria asked EU enforcers to take over the task, Reuters reported.
The move comes as the EU competition regulator girds up to vet more tech, pharma, and biotech startup deals, sending a warning to tech giants criticized by some for so-called killer acquisitions where they buy nascent rivals with the goal of shutting them down.
The world’s largest social network announced the deal in November, which could help it to scale up its instant messaging app WhatsApp, which has seen usage jumped during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Facebook sought approval for the deal from the Austrian competition agency on March 31. “We can confirm that we have received a request for referral from Austria,” a Commission spokeswoman said.
Other national watchdogs have 15 working days to inform the EU competition enforcer whether they too want it to review the deal. “Following the expiry of the deadline for other Member States to join the referral, the Commission will have 10 working days to decide whether to accept or reject the referral,” the spokeswoman said.
Facebook said the deal would bring more innovation to businesses and consumers in a dynamic and competitive space.

Britain’s competition regulator said Thursday that it was referring to Facebook’s acquisition of GIF database Giphy for an in-depth investigation.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) recently completed its initial probe into the Facebook-Giphy merger — which has already closed — and concluded that the deal raises competition concerns.
The watchdog says it found evidence that Giphy had plans to expand its digital advertising partnerships to the U.K. and other markets before the deal was reached. It believes Giphy’s combination with Facebook would mean the firm has less incentive to expand its digital ads business, leading to a potential loss of competition.
The CMA gave the companies five working days to address their concerns about the deal but Facebook refused to do so, the watchdog said.
“We will continue to fully cooperate with the CMA’s investigation,” a Facebook spokesperson told CNBC.
“This merger is good for competition and in the interests of everyone in the UK who uses GIPHY and our services — from developers to service providers to content creators,” the spokesperson added.
Giphy is one of the world’s top libraries for GIFs, animated images involving memes or pop culture references that are shared on the internet. It competes with the likes of Google-owned GIF platform Tenor and the start-up Gfycat.

730,"August 31, 2021",Russia Warns Apple Over Abuse Of Dominant Market Position,"


Russia’s Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) has warned Apple over what it called the US technology giant’s “abuse of its dominant position” in the distribution of apps.
The FAS stated on August 30 that it expected Apple “to eliminate” the violations by September 30.
According to the FAS, it received complaints from users of iOS, a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple exclusively for its hardware, and application developers about Apple’s monopoly.
Namely, the watchdog says, Apple gets a 15% to 30% commission for each payment in the App Store, while users are blocked from being informed about the possibility of purchases out of the App Store for cheaper prices.
“Apple does not allow applications with such characteristics in the App Store, requiring developers to remove links or change the functionality of the application so that the registration form does not lead to external sites,” the FAS stated.
“By these actions, Apple restricts developers in independent behavior, which negatively affects competition and may lead to an increase in prices for developers’ products,” it added.
The FAS also stated the App Store’s guidelines that are mandatory for iOS app developers to comply with prohibits notifying app users of an alternative method of payment for an item.
In April, the FAS fined Apple US$12 million for its “dominant market position” by giving preference to its own applications.
The same month, Moscow enforced controversial legislation demanding that smartphones, tablets, and computers sold in the country come with preinstalled domestic software and apps in what was described by the authorities as an effort to promote Russia’s tech companies.
However, critics say the measure, which requires all devices with Internet access sold in the country to have pre-installed approved software produced by Russian companies, is the latest attempt to tighten state control over the Internet.
Western technology firms have been facing increasing scrutiny in Russia in recent months under the pretext of fighting extremism and protecting minors.

731,"August 31, 2021",South Korea Passes Bill Limiting Apple & Google’s Payment Dominance,"
The South Korean parliament approved a bill on Tuesday, August 31, that will ban major app store operators — like Google and Apple — from requiring developers to only use their payment systems to process the sale of digital products and services, reported The Wall Street Journal.
The legislation will become law once signed by President Moon Jae-in, whose party has been a vocal supporter of the bill.
Apple and Google’s policies usually require developers to pay the tech giants a commission as high as 30% of every transaction.
The bill, approved Tuesday, means that developers will be able to avoid paying commission to major app store operators — like Google and Apple — by directing users to pay via alternate platforms.
An Apple spokesperson said the bill will “put users who purchase digital goods from other sources at risk of fraud, undermine their privacy protections, make it difficult to manage their purchases and features like ‘Ask to Buy’ and Parental Controls will become less effective.”
They added that user trust in App Store purchases will likely decrease as a result of the legislation.
A Google spokesperson said its service fee “helps keep Android free, giving developers the tools and global platform to access billions of consumers around the world.”
“We’ll reflect on how to comply with this law while maintaining a model that supports a high-quality operating system and app store, and we will share more in the coming weeks,” the Google spokesperson added.

The law, sometimes referred to as the Anti-Google Law, was submitted to parliament last August, according to Yonhap News.
It is designed to prevents app store operators with dominant positions from forcing payment systems on app developers and “inappropriately” delaying app reviews or blocks, according to Reuters.
The law also gives the South Korean government the power to mediate disputes regarding payment, cancellations, and refunds in the app market, according to reports.
South Korean parliament approved the bill, and some 180 of the attending lawmakers voted in favor of passing the amendment made to the Telecommunications Business Act, Reuters reported.

732,"August 29, 2021",Apple To Allow Alternate Payment Methods For App Store,"


Apple announced changes to its App Store regulations that will allow software developers to tell customers how to pay for services outside of Apple’s ecosystem, part of a proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit.
The shift will make it easier for some apps to steer customers toward other forms of payment, rather than using the App Store, where Apple charges a commission of up to 30%. The company last year halved most commissions to 15% for developers that generate no more than US$1 million in revenue through the software platform, and the potential settlement will preserve that change.
In 2019, a group of app makers sued Apple, accusing the company of breaching antitrust laws in how it managed its App Store.
The company will also establish a US$100 million fund for small developers. The Small Developer Assistance Fund will allow developers whose sales were less than US$1 million a year from June 2015 to April 2021 to collect between US$250 and US$30,000. It will benefit more than 99% of developers, according to the plaintiffs.
The potential deal is a partial concession to app makers, who have long wanted to get customers to pay them directly for services rather than through Apple to avoid the commission. The company previously prohibited developers from using information about customers they obtained through Apple to inform them directly about other payment options. The potential settlement removes that prohibition, according to plaintiffs. Consumers must consent to such communication, according to Apple.
“This hard-won settlement will bring meaningful improvements to US iOS developers who distribute their digital wares through the App Store, especially for those small developers who bring so much creativity and energy to their work,” said Steve Berman, one of the attorneys who is representing app developers in the lawsuit.

733,"August 29, 2021",Report: Google To Pay Apple $15B To Remain Default In Safari,"


Google could pay close to US$15 billion to Apple this year in order to retain its dominant search position on Apple products.
That report comes from the website Android Central, citing a new research note from Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. The US$15 billion figure comes from Apple’s public filings and analysis of Google’s traffic acquisition costs payments.
As reported here last year, the Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged in an antitrust suit that Google had paid Apple between US$8 billion and US$12 billion to hold the default search status on iPhones and other Apple devices.
The DOJ pointed to the deal to make its case of how Google uses its profits to sideline its rivals, and to show just how much search is worth.
According to Android Central, Sacconaghi suspects Google could pay more this year to prevent Microsoft from outbidding it. At the same time, the tech giant could revisit its strategy soon and try to renegotiate with Apple, as the payments could balloon to US$20 billion next year.
The report notes that there’s also a risk that regulators could block similar deals between Apple and Google, a move that could lead to a 4% to 5% impact on Apple’s gross profits. Apple has stated it supports Google because it is the most popular search engine, but notes users can easily change to different alternatives.

734,"August 26, 2021",Apple To Reduce App Store Fees If Publishers Provide Apple News Content,"


News publishers who participate in Apple News will be eligible to reduce Apple’s cut of first-year in-app subscriptions from 30% to 15%, Apple announced Thursday.
According to CNBC, the move is the latest example of Apple carving out exceptions for its 30% fee for in-app purchases for different industries and types of businesses under increasing scrutiny and criticism from app developers, competitors and regulators.
Apple News is an app that comes pre-installed on iPhones that displays a variety of news stories in a single interface. It has 125 million monthly active users, Apple said, and the app is part of the company’s growing services business that accounted for 21% of Apple’s sales in the most recent quarter.
In order to secure the reduction, the publishers will have to apply to a new program Apple is calling the News Partner Program.
It will require news publishers to agree to supply all their content to Apple in its preferred Apple News file format and that they provide metadata, or information about the stories, required by Apple. Publishers will also be required to have an active, robust presence in the markets where Apple News is available.
Publishers will be able to apply to the program on Apple’s website starting Thursday.
Participants in the program will also be able to get the reduced 15% take rate in the first year for subscriptions initiated through both their own app as well as the Apple News app. Some publications have paywalls on Apple News and allow readers to subscribe through the app.

News publishers are not the highest grossing apps on the App Store. In the U.S., the top 10 grossing publishers booked just more than $68 million in revenue in the first seven months of 2021, said Sensor Tower, a firm tracking App Store trends. Those companies include the publishers of The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, Bloomberg News and CNBC, all of which sell subscription access to paywalled stories through Apple’s App Store.

South Korea is likely to bar Google and Apple from requiring software developers to use their payment systems, effectively stopping them from charging commissions on in-app purchases, the first such curbs on the tech giants by a major economy, reported Reuters.
The parliament’s legislation and judiciary committee is expected on Tuesday, August 24, to approve the amendment of the Telecommunications Business Act, dubbed the “Anti-Google law,” that takes aim at app store operators with dominant market positions.
If the bill gets the committee’s approval, it will be put to a final vote on Wednesday. Lawmakers in South Korea have pushed the issue of the commission structure since mid-2020.
In a statement, Apple stated the bill “will put users who purchase digital goods from other sources at risk of fraud, undermine their privacy protections, make it difficult to manage their purchases.”
The iPhone maker stated it believes “user trust in App Store purchases will decrease as a result of this proposal — leading to fewer opportunities for the over 482,000 registered developers in Korea who have earned more than KRW8.55 trillion to date with Apple.”

Apple and the Justice Department (DOJ) are headed to court, after the company balked at the DOJ’s information request from Apple in its antitrust suit against Google, reported Politico.
DOJ lawyers told US District Judge Amit Mehta they have reached an “impasse” with the company over documents despite weekly negotiations since February.
According to Politico, Apple’s lucrative agreement to set Google as the iPhone’s default search engine is a key to the Justice Department’s case. DOJ alleges that Google pays Apple between US$8 billion and US$12 billion each year for the default spot, a sizable chunk of the iPhone maker’s US$57 billion in profit last year.

737,"August 18, 2021","Australia’s Competition Chief Wants New Laws To Tackle Apple, Google","
Tougher rules are needed to stop platforms like Google and Apple using their market power to push consumers into expensive payment options, according to competition regulator Rod Sims.
In a speech on Thursday, August 18, the chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) will argue that legal battles against digital platforms are insufficient to curb their growing influence over app marketplaces, which may be pushing up prices for consumers.
“Enforcement actions and market studies are necessary to tackle the problems arising from dominant digital platforms, [but] they are not enough on their own,” Mr Sims will tell a global competition webinar, according to an advanced copy of his speech.
“This conclusion is of fundamental importance.” Mr Sims has led the ACCC into many legal battles against digital platforms in recent years, reported The New Daily.
The ACCC published a report into app marketplaces in April. It found the market is plagued with poor transparency, inadequate dispute resolution, and unfair and potentially anti-competitive behavior.
“We do not believe that Apple and Google are striking the right balance between providing streamlined, consistent processes for consumer complaints,” Mr Sims said.

Hyatt Hotels plans to buy resort company Apple Leisure Group from its private-equity owners for $2.7 billion.
The deal for the company, which is owned by KKR & Co. and travel-and-leisure specialist KSL Capital Partners LLC, was announced Sunday after The Wall Street Journal reported it was imminent.
The transaction is the latest sign of optimism about a return to vacation travel even as the U.S. economy continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. Like many travel-related companies, Apple Leisure’s business got clobbered by virus-related lockdowns and travel bans last year, but it has rebounded as restrictions have loosened.
For Chicago-based Hyatt, one of the world’s biggest hospitality companies, the deal would bolster its already considerable resort-management portfolio and give it one of the biggest U.S. providers of charter flights and vacation packages for travel to Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the Caribbean.
It also would accelerate Hyatt’s transformation, long under way, to a more asset-light business model, focusing on generating an ongoing stream of steady and predictable fees.

Apple owes a $300 million lump sum for infringing wireless standard-essential patents owned by IP management company Optis Wireless Technology and its affiliates, a federal jury in an East Texas federal court said Friday after a four-day trial.
A jury ruled last year in the same case that Apple owed $506 million for infringing Plano, Texas-based Optis, PanOptis Patent Management, and Unwired Planet’s LTE patents with technology found in its iPhone and other LTE-capable products. U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap ordered a new trial in his Marshall, Texas, court in April, after finding the award may not have been in line with Optis’ responsibility to license the patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.
“We thank the jury for their time but are disappointed by the verdict and plan to appeal,” Apple spokesperson Josh Rosenstock said in an email. “Optis makes no products and its sole business is to sue companies using patents they accumulate. We will continue to defend against their attempts to extract unreasonable payments.”
Apple’s attorney Mark Selwyn of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Optis and its attorneys Jason Sheasby and Annita Zhong of Irell & Manella.

Microsoft and Kaspersky Lab have settled a dispute that led to antitrust complaints in Europe and an investigation in Russia. As part of the agreement, Microsoft will make changes to the next update of Windows in the spring of 2018.
The settlement comes two months after Kaspersky, a maker of antivirus software, complained to European antitrust regulators that Microsoft was favoring its own security software in the Windows computer operating system, disadvantaging other providers.
Microsoft will give antivirus partners greater visibility into when new versions of Windows will be released and let them use their own alerts and notifications to tell customers to renew products, the Redmond, Washington-based company said in a blog post.
Windows will also change how it notifies users of expirations, moving from an alert that could be ignored to one that persists until the user takes action. The changes will affect Windows updates released globally.

From Microsoft to Google: eyes wide shut on predatory innovation? By Dr. Thibault Schrepel
On June 27, 2017, the European Commission (“Commission”) has fined Google 2.7 billion dollars1 for having abused its dominant position by giving illegal advantage to its own comparison shopping service. According to the Commission, Google had notably “demoted rival comparison shopping services in its search results.” We do not know – yet – if that demotion was purely contractual, but if it also involved technical changes, it would mean that Google has implemented practices of  predatory  innovation. We shall soon know, once a non-confidential version of the decision will be made public.
And we are already expecting another decision to be released against Google, in the Android case. In its statement of objections,2 the European Commission held that Google imposed restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators. Some of them are technical – those related to anti-fragmentation, for instance.
These strategies – without making any assumption about their legality in these particular cases – are falling within the definition of predatory innovation which covers the “alteration of one or more technical elements of a product to limit or eliminate competition.”3 And they are implemented on a daily basis.

742,"June 20, 2017","EU: Microsoft details its security process, amid Kaspersky antitrust complaint","
A couple of weeks ago, Eugene Kaspersky, from the Russian multinational cyber security and anti-virus provider Kaspersky, fired shots at Microsoft and filed a new antitrust complaint against the company in the European Union. The issue as heart at the time was Microsoft’s Windows Defender antivirus solution, and Microsoft pushing its own antivirus over third party software in Windows 10. Now that some time has passed, Microsoft has indirectly responded to Kaspersky’s antitrust complaints by highlighting its antivirus efforts in a new post to the TechNet blog.
Titled “Partnering with the AV ecosystem to protect our Windows 10 customers,” the 1,000-word post is penned by Rob Lefferts, Partner Director, Windows & Devices Group, Security & Enterprise at Microsoft. He highlights the impacts of the WannaCry attacks and addresses the importance of how Microsoft is trying to make Windows 10 the safest and most secure version of Windows ever.
Though Lefferts does not address Kaspersky directly in the post, he does mention that Microsoft’s approach to security in Windows 10 “includes both the end-to-end protections we build in natively, as well as support for the larger ecosystem of ISV [Indepedent Software Vendors] and OEM partners to do their best work.” This would appear to address Kaspersky’s claim that Microsoft is using its “dominant position” to promote Windows Defender.

744,"June 6, 2017",EU: Kaspersky files antitrust complaints against Microsoft,"
Russian security software maker Kaspersky Lab has filed antitrust complaints against Microsoft with the European Commission and the German federal cartel office, it said in a statement on Tuesday.
Kaspersky Lab said Microsoft was abusing its dominance in the PC operating system market, creating obstacles for independent software security vendors by distributing its own Defender anti-virus software with the ubiquitous Windows operating system.
Microsoft built the anti virus software into Windows, saying this protected users but Kaspersky said it was anti-competitive.
Microsoft said in a statement on Tuesday that it had not violated any laws.
“Microsoft’s primary objective is to keep customers protected,” the company said in an emailed statement. “We are confident that the security features of Windows 10 comply with competition laws. And we will answer any questions regulators may have.”
Kaspersky filed the complaints after the two companies failed to resolve their differences through private negotiations.
The Moscow-based company said in a statement that Microsoft’s action had resulted in “a lower level of protection for users, a limitation on their right to choose and financial losses both for users and security solutions manufacturers.”
Kaspersky in November threatened to complain to the European Commission but in April said it would hold off because Microsoft had agreed to make some changes.

747,"April 30, 2017",Russia: Kaspersky calls off antitrust dispute with Microsoft,"
Kaspersky, the popular computer security firm based in Russia, has withdrawn its antitrust complaint against software giant Microsoft though the dispute is not totally gone. The security vendor lambasted Microsoft for allegedly taking advantage of its market influence to edge out antivirus providers.
The dispute arose from the new changes Microsoft introduced in the Creators Update that made Windows Defender the preferred security tool for Windows 10. The Creators Update removes some third-party security products from PCs that upgrade to the update. For Kaspersky, that means exposing users to security risks. The move also aims to force out security vendors, according to Eugene Kaspersky, founder and chief executive:
“Several years ago Microsoft decided to overhaul the Windows platform. Ostensibly this was in the name of better ease of usage, security, performance and so on. Behind the scenes what Microsoft was up to was elegantly seizing niche markets: squeezing independent developers out of them, taking their place, and offering users their own products, which in many cases were in no way better.” Said in the Kaspersky’s blog.

Google is overhauling its plans for targeted online advertising after pushback from privacy advocates, aiming to give marketers less-granular information about web users than under the tech giant’s initial proposal, reported The Wall Street Journal.
The Alphabet unit said Tuesday that the new system it is proposing, Topics, would allow web advertisers to target broad categories of users—those interested in “fitness” or “travel,” for example—instead of grouping them into thousands of cohorts with similar browsing histories.
The company’s Chrome browser will distill a shortlist of interests based on a user’s recent browsing history, the company said. Users will be able to see and delete interests the browser assigns to them, or turn the system off entirely.
The proposal is an outgrowth of Google’s plan to phase out a user-tracking technology called third-party cookies in 2023. Millions of marketers currently rely on third-party cookies, unique snippets of code to identify individual browsers, to target online advertisements based on users’ specific browsing histories. The practice has led to complaints from activists and privacy regulators in Europe and the US.

German media companies want the European Union to prevent Google from removing third-party cookies from its Chrome browser, claiming the move will eat into critical ad revenues for news organizations.
Axel Springer and hundreds of other publishers, advertisers, and content providers claim that Google parent Alphabet is breaking European antitrust laws with its plan to gradually phase out cookies from its signature web browser.
If Google were to follow through on the plan, it could result in revenue losses of up to 70% for media entities that rely on the search engine’s cookies to generate clicks through analyzing user preferences.
The complaint was filed with EU antitrust regulators in Brussels on Monday, according to the Financial Times.
While Google claims the move is being done to safeguard users’ privacy, the publishers claimed that Google will still be able to use alternative methods to collect data that will benefit its own advertising service while leaving competitors in the lurch.
“Publishers must remain in a position where they are allowed to ask their users for consent to process data, without Google capturing this decision,” according to the complaint.

The suits allege that the search giant made misleading promises about how much privacy it could guarantee users dating back to at least 2014.
Google also allegedly used “dark patterns”, user interface tricks employed by websites to get individuals to do things against their will,  to inadvertently make consumers share more data, the attorneys general claim.

The attorneys general of Texas, Washington and Indiana are expected to file lawsuits in their own states as well.

The case centers on Google’s shopping service and is one of three against the search engine giant currently moving through the EU’s drawn-out appeals system.
The new appeal could take up to two years to reach an outcome, stretching the case out to well more than a decade after the commission launched its investigation in 2010.

The court confirmation on Google Shopping was a win for the EU’s antitrust supremo Margrethe Vestager, who burst onto the scene in Brussels by scrapping her predecessor’s more conciliatory approach to the US Internet giant.

754,"January 23, 2022",Google Asks Judge To Dismiss Texas Antitrust Case,"


On Friday Google asked a federal court to dismiss an antitrust lawsuit led by the State of Texas. According to the New York Times this is the first time it has sought to have one of the government competition cases against it thrown out in the United States.
Google wrote in a filing that the state had failed to show that it engaged in anticompetitive behavior and hadn’t proved that an agreement between Facebook and Google, a core part of the case, violated the law.
“We’re confident that this case is wrong on the facts and the law, and should be dismissed,” said Adam Cohen, the company’s director of economic policy.

The Texas lawsuit argues that Google has obtained and abused a monopoly over the labyrinthine set of systems that allow publishers to auction off ad space to marketers. The states argue that Google misled publishers and advertisers about the nature of the ad auctions, allowing it to pocket more of the money flowing through its ad systems. And they say the company used a deal with Facebook to maintain its dominance when the publishers tried to develop an alternative system.
“Despite amassing a lengthy collection of grievances, each one comes down to a plea for Google to share its data or to design its products in ways that would help its rivals,” Google said in its filing.
Texas’ attorney general, Ken Paxton, said in a statement: “Google’s motion attributes their monopoly status to pure success on the merits. The company whose motto was once ‘Don’t Be Evil’ now asks the world to examine their egregious monopoly abuses and see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil.”

By Germán Bet, Roger D. Blair & Javier D. Donna (University of Florida)
In 2020, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an antitrust suit against Google alleging that Google has unlawfully monopolized the markets for general search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising. The complaint raises questions involving market definition, monopoly power, and monopolizing conduct. In this article, we examine these issues through the lens of microeconomic principles. Our analysis finds that there is a sound economic rationale for the DOJ’s complaint.

Apple and Google argued to lawmakers Tuesday, January 18, that bipartisan antitrust legislation aimed at curbing the power of big technology companies would harm the privacy and security of users if it becomes law, reported the LA Times.
Escalating its opposition to the legislation, Apple sent a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Richard J. Durbin; the panel’s ranking Republican, Charles E. Grassley; Antitrust Subcommittee Chair Amy Klobuchar; and the subcommittee’s ranking Republican, Mike Lee. The letter, which was obtained by Bloomberg News, underscores Apple’s push to protect its App Store from government oversight and changes that would disrupt its business model.
“After a tumultuous year that witnessed multiple controversies regarding social media, whistle-blower allegations of long-ignored risks to children, and ransomware attacks that hobbled critical infrastructure, it would be ironic if Congress responds by making it much harder to protect the privacy and security of Americans’ personal devices,” Tim Powderly, Apple’s senior director of government affairs, wrote in the letter. “Unfortunately, that is what these bills would do.”

757,"January 14, 2022",Facebook & Google Accused Of ‘Secret Deal’ Causing Unfair Competition Edge,"


Chief executives of Google and Facebook personally oversaw a 2018 deal that advantaged Facebook on Google’s ad auctions, a group of state attorneys general alleged in court documents Friday.
The complaint also alleges Google manipulated its ad pricing tiers under a secret program called Project Bernanke that removed second-place bids on ad auctions. It allowed Google to pocket part of the difference between first and third-place bids while also harming publishers that rely on ad revenue and who could have made more from higher bids.
Under the agreement with Facebook, Google and Facebook illegally collaborated to decrease prices paid to publishers, cut out rival ad networks and manipulate ad auctions operated by publishers, the complaint says.
The new filing shows just how far up the arrangement, alleged in earlier filings, went. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, whose name is redacted in the complaint, called the agreement “a big deal strategically” in an email including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose name was also redacted. Sandberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai signed off on the deal’s terms, the states allege, noting Sandberg was previously a high-ranking executive in Google’s advertising business. Sandberg’s signoff was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.

758,"January 12, 2022",France’s Top Court Upholds Google’s Fine,"


Google’s bid to overturn a €100 million (US$114.4 million) French fine hit a snag after an aide to the nation’s top court backed accusations against the search engine over its cookies policy, reported Bloomberg.
The Alphabet unit has been embroiled in a court fight over the then-record fine in 2020 for targeting users with cookies without their consent and failing to offer a simple way to reject the tracking devices. Google was hit with a new record €150 million (US$171.6 million) penalty last week for still not allowing users an easy way out of its cookies.
But court adviser Laurent Domingo said at a hearing Wednesday, January 12, that the initial penalty was justified because Google “failed to abide” by its “obligations, even though these were clear.” 
He criticized Google for failing to seek the consent of google.fr users to place cookies on their computers or informing them adequately, and for having an inefficient mechanism to block these tracking devices.
European Union data protection regulators have gained unprecedented fining powers since the bloc’s so-called General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, took effect in May 2018, which allows them to levy penalties of as much as 4% of a company’s annual global sales. The latest Google fines are based on yet another set of rules regulating the use of online tracking devices and come amid a much fiercer climate of regulatory scrutiny of tech giants worldwide.

759,"January 12, 2022",German Cartel Office Turns Its Eyes On Google News Showcase,"


The German Federal Cartel Office, the Bundeskartellamt, is launching a consultation with the press publishing industry to assess the measures taken by Google to smooth out competition concerns with regards to Google News Showcase.
The Federal Cartel Office started a proceeding against Google to investigate Google News Showcase under antitrust laws in response to the complaint made by Corint Media last June.
The examination is largely based on the authority’s competences under the new rules for large digital companies. The investigation follows the authority’s most recent decision determining Google’s “paramount significance for competition across markets” within the meaning of Section 19a(1) German Competition Act (GWB). Google is thus subject to special abuse control by the Bundeskartellamt pursuant to Section 19a(2) GWB, which is relevant in this proceeding.
Google News Showcase is a news service offered by Google giving publishing companies the opportunity to present their contents in prominent “story panels”. The publishers’ “story panels” are displayed under Google News and Google Discover.
Andreas Mundt, President of the Bundeskartellamt said, “Google has proposed measures to respond to our competition concerns relating to Google News Showcase. The company no longer plans to include Showcase content in the general search results. The conditions for participating in Google News Showcase are not intended to prevent publishers from enforcing their general ancillary copyright. Access to Google News Showcase is based on objective criteria. We rely on the assessment of the market players affected to ensure that the measures proposed by Google are effective. In view of the wide variety of interests the publishers may have we are thus conducting broader consultations in the sector.”
Google has already changed some of the practices under examination and declared its willingness to address any remaining ambiguities and concerns by modifying the Showcase contracts and providing clarifying statements.

760,"June 22, 2021",Amazon’s $6.4B MGM Acquisition Probed By FTC,"
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will be the agency to review Amazon’s proposed acquisition of Hollywood studio MGM, the Wall Street Journal. Amazon’s US$6.4 billion MGM deal was announced in May.  
Amazon announced its deal for MGM, which would boost its Prime Video streaming platform in a market that includes rivals such as Netflix and Walt Disney MGM has a library of more than 4,000 films, including the James Bond franchise, and a TV catalog that includes “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “Vikings.”
Companies doing sizable mergers have to submit their deals for government antitrust review. The FTC shares antitrust authority with the Justice Department, and the two agencies split up the work of reviewing proposed deals. The Department has recently reviewed transactions involving video content, including Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox and AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner, a deal the Department unsuccessfully attempted to block in court.
During recent interagency negotiations, the FTC secured the right to review Amazon’s US$6.4 billion MGM deal, the people familiar with the matter said. The FTC pushed for jurisdiction over the merger review because it already has an open, wide-ranging antitrust investigation into Amazon’s business practices, the people said.
The FTC and the Justice Department previously agreed to divide up investigations of four leading tech giants’ conduct, with the Department taking Google and Apple, while the FTC took Facebook and Amazon.
The MGM review could present an early test for new FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan, who made her name in antitrust circles in large part by criticizing Amazon. She wrote a widely read law-review article while at Yale Law School that argued US antitrust law has failed to restrain the online retailer.
Amazon is a growing producer of its own video content and has become an aggressive buyer of sports rights including those for the National Football League. But it still has a relatively modest library compared with traditional media giants.
MGM is now one of the smaller studios in Hollywood, meaning the tie-up isn’t necessarily the kind of transaction that in the past would have raised immediate red flags about anticompetitive concentration. But in light of Amazon’s broader marketplace footprint, the addition of MGM could raise concerns about the expansion of the online giant’s platform, which critics in Washington already believe is too powerful.

761,"June 17, 2021",There’s a New Duo That Could Help Rein In Amazon,"


By Stacy Mitchell, New York Times
In a welcome joining of forces, labor unions and small-business advocacy groups this month supported an antitrust bill that would give New York State sweeping new authority to sue corporate titans like Amazon for abusing their market power in ways that harm competitors or workers.
Labor and small business make an unusual political pairing these days. The idea that small businesses are aligned with big businesses and opposed to labor unions took hold in the 1980s and has been conventional wisdom ever since.
But this alignment wasn’t always the case. In the decades after the Great Depression, unions and small businesses were natural allies in a New Deal coalition that backed muscular policies to limit corporate power. Fortunately, a growing antimonopoly movement is rekindling this alliance, which could be critical in reversing labor’s long decline.

762,"June 16, 2021",Amazon Blames Fake Product Reviews On Social Media ,"


In its ongoing fight to stamp out fake product reviews and earn customers’ trust, Amazon is calling upon social media companies and consumer protection regulators to do more to protect unwitting buyers and well-intentioned sellers from a growing spate of fraudulent activity.
The call for external help was made in an unsigned Wednesday (June 16) company blog post, in which Amazon addressed the many problems surrounding its popular and highly impactful product review system, which allows users to leave comments and rate their experiences by leaving one to five stars.
In acknowledging the importance of product reviews and the role they play in influencing the decisions of its 300 million active customers — and in turn the fortunes of its 1.9 million sellers — Amazon said it continues to invest and innovate to allow only genuine product reviews in its store.
While the online giant said it had stopped more than 200 million fake reviews before they were ever seen by customers, and that 99 percent of review enforcement was driven by its own proactive detection, it needs help from outside the company’s walls to finish the job.
“While we appreciate that some social media companies have become much faster at responding,” Amazon said, “to address this problem at scale, it is imperative for social media companies to invest adequately in proactive controls to detect and enforce fake reviews ahead of our reporting the issue to them.”
Amazon did say the response time had markedly improved but stressed the need to still do more. For example, in the first quarter of 2020, Amazon said it reported more than 300 groups associated with fake reviews to unnamed social media companies that took an average of 45 days to shut them down. But in Q1 of 2021, Amazon said that lag time had shortened to just five days, noting that its collaborative approach was working.

763,"June 16, 2021","New Antitrust Bills Zero In Amazon, Apple, Facebook & Google","


Last week US lawmakers fired a shot across Big Tech’s bow, introducing five new bills designed to curb what lawmakers have described as “unregulated power” held by the firms of Silicon Valley. If enacted, the legislation would mark the biggest changes to US antitrust law in decades.
And while the legislation will affect all firms, their congressional architects have been open in naming the specific targets of the legislation.
“Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google have prioritized power over innovation and harmed American businesses and consumers in the process,” Rep. Ken Buck (R-Col.), the ranking member on the House antitrust subcommittee, said in a statement. “These companies have maintained monopoly power in the online marketplace by using a variety of anticompetitive behaviors to stifle competition.”
The new pieces of legislation would prohibit a dominant platform from discriminating against rivals by offering its own products preference (American Innovation and Choice Online Act); stop firms from using acquisitions as a means of neutralizing potential threats (Platform Competition and Opportunity Act); ban dominant platform from using their power across multiple types of business to give themselves unfair advantages (Ending Platform Monopolies Act); make it easier for consumers to move their data when they want to switch to a new provider (Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching Act); and change filing fees for the first time in two decades, providing the government funds to pursue antitrust actions.
Those bills are a long way and a lot of subcommittee hearings between now and becoming law — though regulation of Big Tech is one of the few areas where bipartisan action is still possible, as both Republicans and Democrats have qualms about the power Big Tech wields, and a determined interest in reining it in. And while the players most directly targeted by the new bills have not as yet offered any public comment, they will get their chance this week as they have been invited to appear before the House to testify.

India’s antitrust watchdog plans to expedite a restarted probe into allegations of anti-competitive behavior at Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart, as it intensifies scrutiny of big-tech firms, two people close to the matter said.
The comments come as major US technology firms, including Twitter and Facebook, are at loggerheads with the government over issues such as data privacy bills and policies some industry executives have called protectionist.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) initiated a probe in January last year on the basis of a complaint alleging Amazon and Flipkart promoted select sellers on their e-commerce platforms and that deep discounts stifled competition.
Near-immediate legal challenges from the pair stalled the probe for over a year until a court last week allowed it to resume, having dismissed arguments that the CCI lacked evidence.
Though Amazon and Flipkart are likely to appeal, the CCI plans to demand information from them related to the allegations “as quickly as possible,” said one of the people, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The investigation “will be expedited,” the person said. Such investigations in India typically take months to complete.
The CCI is speeding up all cases involving big technology firms, including by deploying additional officers for some cases and working to more stringent internal deadlines, said the two people, who are familiar with the watchdog’s thinking.
“Cases involving digital firms are getting priority at CCI as they can have a significant impact on the economy and Indian startups,” said one of the people.

The US Federal Trade Commission on Friday approved a consent order against Amazon that requires the company to pay $61.7m to resolve charges that for two and a half years it took tips intended for Amazon Flex drivers and concealed the diversion of funds.
The deal was proposed in February but required sign-off from the US trade watchdog. It arises from FTC charges that Amazon misrepresented both to Amazon Flex drivers and to the public what the company would pay for delivery work.
The tech giant launched its Flex service in 2015, promising drivers – which it classified as independent contractors and referred to as “delivery partners” – that it would pay $18-25 per hour for the delivery of goods from Amazon.com, Prime Now (household goods), Amazon Fresh (groceries), and Amazon Restaurant (takeout).
Amazon’s ads made promises like, “You will receive 100 per cent of the tips you earn while delivering with Amazon Flex.”
However, during the period from late 2016 through August 2019, drivers – who, as independent contractors, paid for their own car, fuel, maintenance, and insurance – saw only a portion of the promised gratuity when customers opted to tip.

An Indian court dismissed pleas by Amazon.com and Walmart’s Flipkart to quash an antitrust investigation into the business practices of the US firms, dealing them a blow in their key growth market.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) announced its investigation in January 2020 after a trader group’s complaint accused the firms of promoting some “preferred sellers” and hurting business for smaller sellers.
A court had put the investigation on hold last year after Amazon and Flipkart challenged it saying the CCI had no evidence the e-commerce giants were harming competition.
On Friday, Justice P.S. Dinesh Kumar of the high court in the southern state of Karnataka said he was dismissing the petitions by Amazon and Flipkart, and refused them any further relief.
“It would be unwise to prejudge the issues … at this stage and scuttle the investigation,” Kumar wrote in his 51-page order.
Amazon said it would review the order “carefully and then decide on the next steps”. Flipkart did not immediately respond.
Abir Roy, a lawyer for the Indian trader group Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, told Reuters the judge’s decision effectively paves the way to restart the investigation, which has been on hold since February 2020.

A European Union privacy regulator has proposed a fine of more than US$425 million against Amazon, part of a process that could yield the biggest-yet penalty under the bloc’s privacy law, people familiar with the matter said.
Luxembourg’s data-protection commission, the CNPD, has circulated a draft decision sanctioning Amazon’s privacy practices and proposing the fine among the bloc’s 26 other national authorities, the people said. The CNPD is Amazon’s lead privacy regulator in the EU because Amazon has its EU headquarters in the Grand Duchy.
The Luxembourg case relates to alleged violations of Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) linked to Amazon’s collection and use of personal data, and isn’t related to its cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services, one of the people familiar with the matter said. The person declined to elaborate on the specific allegations against Amazon.
An Amazon spokesman declined to comment. The company has previously stated the privacy of its customers is a priority and it complies with the law in all countries where it operates. A spokesman for the CNPD said the regulator wasn’t allowed to comment on individual cases.
Before the draft decision can become final, it must effectively be agreed by other EU privacy regulators, a process that could take months and lead to substantive changes, including a higher or lower fine.

The UK’s competition watchdog is planning a formal competition investigation into Amazon, mirroring a continuing investigation by the EU, according to three people familiar with the situation, reported The Financial Times.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been analyzing Amazon’s business for months, focusing on how the online retailer uses the data it collects on its platform. It has also scrutinized how Amazon decides which merchants appear in the crucial “buy box” — the white panel to the right-hand side of a product where buyers click to add the item to their cart. 
An investigation into Amazon may focus on whether the company favors merchants that also use its logistics and delivery services when deciding who has access to the buy box and to its Prime customers, according to two individuals close to the situation. The timing and scope of the probe were still being worked on, people with direct knowledge of the plans said. Both the UK and the EU also recently announced probes into Facebook’s allegedly anti-competitive behavior.

Amazon and US delivery company Gopuff, which is backed by SoftBank, are both looking at buying up Germany-based Flink, sources told Bloomberg. Flink has already spurned a bid from Gopuff.
The status of Amazon’s and Gopuff competing buyout bids is unclear, but delivery apps are increasingly looking at buying up potential rivals in Europe.
Flink, a grocery-delivery startup, raised US$240 million earlier this month. Backers included Prosus, investment company Bond and Mubadala Capital. The Berlin-based Flink, which launched just six months ago, has partnered with the Rewe Group supermarket chain.
“The order growth we have seen over the past weeks has been explosive,” said Co-founder Oliver Merkel. Flink stated it already has more than 50 local hubs and is opening a new hub every two days. The delivery company also noted that it reaches more than three million customers every day. Flink — which means “quick” in German — delivers groceries in Germany, France, and the Netherlands.
Meanwhile, Gopuff has big expansion ambitions. Last month, the company announced it was acquiring the on-demand delivery platform Fancy in the UK. The value of the deal was not disclosed. In a press release, the company noted that the deal marked its first foray into international markets. Daniel Folkman, Gopuff’s senior vice president of business, said his company plans to expand onto the continent as well. “At Gopuff, we have been consistently focused on responsible growth, strategically establishing the physical infrastructure and footprint needed to bring Instant Needs to new geographies and customers,” said Folkman.
Fancy vows to deliver products in 30 minutes or less using “micro-fulfillment centers” in six cities across the UK. The goal of using micro-fulfillment centers is to supply products to the actual consumer, thereby cutting down on the time needed to deliver online orders. Fancy and Gopuff share similar delivery models, as Gopuff calls itself the go-to platform for consumers’ immediate, everyday needs.

As Mark Zuckerberg tries to sell Congress on Facebook’s preferred method of amending the federal law that serves as a key pillar of the internet, lawmakers must see it for what it really is: a self-serving and cynical effort to cement the company’s dominance.
In prepared testimony submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee before a Thursday hearing, Zuckerberg proposes amending 47 U.S.C. § 230 (“Section 230”), the federal law that generally protects online services and users from liability for hosting user-generated content that others believe is unlawful.
The vague and ill-defined proposal calls for lawmakers to condition Section 230’s legal protections on whether services can show “that they have systems in place for identifying unlawful content and removing it.” According to Zuckerberg, this revised law would not create liability if a particular piece of unlawful content fell through the cracks. Instead, the law would impose a duty of care on platforms to have adequate “systems in place” with respect to how they review, moderate, and remove user-generated content…

Facebook and Amazon have become the US’s two biggest corporate lobbying spenders, investing almost twice as much as oil giant ExxonMobil and tobacco company Philip Morris in 2020, according to a new report.
Amazon increased its spending on lobbying efforts by 30% during the period from 2018 to 2020 to reach US$18.7 million, according to a report published by Public Citizen, a progressive consumer rights advocacy group, and based on data by the Center for Responsive Politics. Facebook spent 56% more in the same period to reach around US$19.6 million, the report found.
ExxonMobil spent US$8.69 million on lobbying efforts in 2020, according to its public Lobbying Disclosure Act filings. While Philip Morris spent US$6.95 million in lobbying in 2020 according to data published by the Center for Responsive Politics.
The Public Citizen report evaluated the influence of the four tech giants—Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple— on regulators and lawmakers through lobbying and contributions.
“The foundation of the Big Tech companies’ influence are their lobbying teams, which use campaign contributions, existing relationships, and past experience to swing policy in their favor,” Public Citizen stated in the report.

Britain’s competition watchdog on Thursday, March 25, gave Facebook and Giphy five working days to offer proposals to address its concerns over their merger deal, which could affect digital advertizing and the supply of animated images. Regulators in the United Kingdom announced that Facebook’s acquisition of animated image search engine Giphy raises competition concerns.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had first announced that it would be looking into the move last July. In a statement Thursday, the regulatory agency said that Giphy had previously competed with Facebook in digital advertising via paid brand partnerships.
The CMA stated that if the merger remains in place, Giphy may have “less incentive” to expand its digital marketing, thus lessening competition in that market.
The agency also found that the deal could ultimately harm Facebook’s rivals if Giphy chose to stop providing GIFs to other social media platforms or require they provide more data to use the search engine.
“Many people use GIFs when they communicate online, so it’s important that platforms aren’t restricted in what they can offer and people have a range of options to pick from,” said Andre Gomes da Silva, the executive director of markets and mergers at the CMA.
The agency is requesting that Facebook and Giphy offer “legally binding proposals” to address the outlined concerns within the next five business days.
“We will continue to fully cooperate with the CMA’s investigation,” a Facebook spokesperson told The Hill. “This merger is good for competition and in the interests of everyone in the UK who uses Giphy and our services – from developers to service providers to content creators.”
The CMA will then either accept a potential offer or refer the case to a second investigation.
Regulators in Australia are conducting their own independent investigation into whether the deal may give Facebook data that strengthens its market power or harms online messaging rivals.

774,"March 25, 2021",Facebook’s Zuckerberg Proposes Changes To Section 230,"


This week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg proposed that Congress make revisions to federal internet regulations that would require platforms to have systems in place for identifying and removing unlawful content.
The proposal, which Zuckerberg presented during his testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday, March 25, would raise the bar for social media companies that are currently granted immunity from liability for the content that appears on their platforms. That immunity, granted by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, has come under fire in recent years from Republicans and Democrats.
While meant to ensure that companies are taking action against unlawful content, the changes could theoretically shore up Facebook’s power, as well as that of other internet giants like Google, by requiring smaller social media companies and startups to develop robust content moderation systems that can be costly.
“Instead of being granted immunity, platforms should be required to demonstrate that they have systems in place for identifying unlawful content and removing it,” Zuckerberg said in his opening remarks, according to written testimony released on the House Committee website Wednesday.
Under Section 230, Facebook, Google, and other internet giants bear no legal liability for content that appears on their platforms. Zuckerberg’s proposal would keep those protections in place, but would make platforms liable for having systems to protect against unlawful content.
“Platforms should not be held liable if a particular piece of content evades its detection — that would be impractical for platforms with billions of posts per day — but they should be required to have adequate systems in place to address unlawful content,” he said, according to the written testimony.

It is one of several authorities Facebook is fighting in the region, including a lawsuit against European Commission last year over a preliminary antitrust probe, which managed to slow down EU investigators’ demand for data. It has also taken legal action against Ireland’s privacy watchdog and was chastised by a UK court for ignoring the country’s merger watchdog.

776,"March 21, 2021",Republican FTC Commissioner Talks Facebook Antitrust Suit,"


Noah Phillips, Republican commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), explained why he voted against bringing the agency’s antitrust lawsuit against Facebook during a hearing before the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.
According to CNBC, Phillips said he believes the length of time that has lapsed since Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 presents an obstacle for enforcers. The FTC reviewed both merger proposals at the time and decided not to block them, allowing Facebook to move forward with the deals and make the apps integral parts of its own business.
“A big part of this goes to the integrity of the process,” Phillips said, adding that he agrees that the law allows the agency to reevaluate mergers after they are consummated. “But as a general matter in terms of mergers, the longer you wait, the more investments the company make[s]. And I think that presents a real issue.”
The FTC voted 3-2 to bring the case in December, with then-Republican Chairman Joe Simons voting with the two Democratic commissioners.
Merger law allows for enforcement agencies to reevaluate deals. A decision not to block a deal has no bearing on future enforcement. But, Phillips testified, the fact that Facebook has subsequently invested in Instagram and WhatsApp, around which the lawsuit focuses, presents a practical problem. 
Phillips was not a commissioner at the time that the FTC evaluated the mergers. 
According to CNBC, Phillips said he also had some concerns on the merits, including with the market definition and effects under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, though he did not go into detail.Still, Phillips said he thinks enforcers today are more willing to bring a skeptical lens to merger cases than before, especially when they involve nascent competitors.
“We’re a little bit less concerned with the risks of over-enforcement and a little more concerned about the risks of under-enforcement,” Phillips said regarding merger cases with nascent competitors “We are hearing the message and we are concerned about this dynamic.”

777,"March 19, 2021",Facebook May Face New Antitrust Probe In UK,"


Britain’s competition regulator is set to begin an antitrust investigation into Facebook in the next few months, after similar actions into Google and Apple early this year, the Financial Times reported on Friday, March 19.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) would look into the way Facebook allegedly uses customer data against rivals in social media and online advertising, people close to the matter told FT.
The investigation is also likely to examine Facebook’s status as a so-called gatekeeper for its ability to collect data from users to boost its advantage over rivals.
A person close to the CMA said the probe would draw on the regulator’s report on digital advertising, which highlighted the “strong incumbency advantage” Facebook benefited from in areas such as online ads and social media.
The timing of the official announcement of the probe and the exact concerns could still shift, these people warned. But legal experts said Facebook had so far escaped the intense scrutiny its rivals were facing in the UK, so there would be a strong appetite among regulators to pursue a case.

778,"March 16, 2021",Facebook Agrees To Pay News Corp For Content In Australia,"
News Corp has struck a three-year deal to provide news to Facebook in Australia, ending a battle between two billionaire-owned empires being watched worldwide as a possible template for regulating Big Tech, reported The Financial Times.
The Rupert Murdoch-controlled publisher announced on Monday, March 15, the agreement would allow it to “provide access to trusted news and information to millions of Facebook users” in the country through the social media network’s dedicated news tab. Financial details were not disclosed.
The deal includes content from The Australian newspaper, the Sydney-based Daily Telegraph, and the Melbourne-based Herald Sun as well as regional publications, News Corp said in a statement. The pay television channel Sky News Australia has reached a parallel deal, it added. 
The agreements come after Australia last month passed a controversial law designed to force major technology platforms such as Facebook and Google to pay publishers for news content.
Online platforms have grabbed the vast majority of digital advertising, sapping traditional publishers of resources to cover local and regional news. Lawmakers in the US, UK, and Canada have suggested taking similar steps to shift commercial power towards struggling news outlets.

Google and Facebook have been in high profile dispute in Australia as to implementation of a news bargaining code promoted by a competition regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (“ACCC”). Why is the Australian Government legislating to require Google and Facebook to pay media proprietors? What is the competition policy rationale for the ACCC being involved in this dispute? Why is continuing disruption of the business of production of in-depth or investigative journalism being addressed by a competition regulator? Why do both the competition regulator and the Australian Government refer to market power of Google and Facebook as a relevant concern to the question of whether, and if so, how much, these global digital platforms “should” pay to media proprietors? These questions have uniquely Australian answers, as examined in this paper. However, the media policy concerns that underlie these questions are common across many countries, some of which are considering levy, subsidy or targeted taxation schemes to transfer value from global digital platforms to domestic media proprietors. This paper considers how and why media policy concerns arising from disruption of news journalism business arose and came to be associated with business success in Australia and elsewhere of Google and Facebook.

A bipartisan trio of senators introduced a bill that would rein in app stores of companies they said exert too much market control, including Apple and Alphabet’s Google, reported Reuters. 
Senators Richard Blumenthal and Amy Klobuchar, both Democrats, teamed up with Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn to sponsor the bill, which would bar big app stores from requiring app providers to use their payment system. It would also prohibit them from punishing apps that offer different prices or conditions through another app store or payment system.
“I found this predatory abuse of Apple and Google so deeply offensive on so many levels,” Blumenthal said in an interview on Wednesday, August 11. “Their power has reached a point where they are impacting the whole economy in stifling and strangling innovation.”
Blumenthal said he expected companion legislation to be introduced in the House of Representatives “very soon.” The bill would also bar app stores from using non-public information about apps to compete with them.

781,"August 8, 2021",Apple Wins Court Ruling On $308.5M Patent Suit,"


Apple persuaded a federal judge to throw out a US$308.5 million jury verdict it lost to a privately-held licensing firm for infringing a patent associated with digital rights management.
In a Thursday night, August 5, decision, US District Judge Rodney Gilstrap said Personalized Media Communications intentionally delayed filing its application with the US Patent and Trademark Office, hoping to obtain a larger payout.
“This court takes very seriously the prospect of disturbing the unanimous verdict of a duly empaneled jury,” but PMC’s “deliberate strategy of delay” was a “conscious and egregious misuse of the statutory patent system,” Gilstrap wrote.
PMC, based in Sugar Land, Texas, claimed in its 2015 lawsuit that the FairPlay software used in Apple’s iTunes service and App Store to decrypt movies, music, and apps infringed its patent obtained in 2012.
But the judge, who sits in Marshall, Texas, accepted Apple’s defense of “prosecution laches,” which can block a patent holder from enforcing a patent after an unreasonable and unexplained delay. Gilstrap said PMC’s delay lasted many years.

782,"August 3, 2021",Disruptive Innovations on Digital Platforms:  Lessons from Epic Games v. Apple in the U.S. and Rappi v. iFood in Brazil,"

By Victor Oliveira Fernandes*
 
Invoking core insights from theories of disruptive innovation in order to explain competition among digital platforms has become commonplace in competition law literature.1 Tales of how Google overtook AltaVista or how Facebook overcame MySpace2 are often told to illustrate how market power in the digital world could be fleeting.
While these anedoctes do indeed help us understand there is a vital element of technological discontinuity in competition among digital platforms,3 it is not easy to translate these lessons into concrete proposals for competition policy. When investigating digital markets, antitrust agencies might struggle with whether past events of disruption are a reliable guide for antitrust purposes. Especially when facing today’s highly concentrated market, it is not clear whether the iconic downfall of former market leaders reveals something about the future.
This article briefly claims that theories of disruptive innovation have little value as a normative policy guide for competition law.4 That is because the core purpose of these theories is to point out business behavior patterns, and not to serve as crystal balls. Instead, antitrust authorities could better incorporate these theories as analytical lenses, i.e. as descriptive frameworks to unveil the economic rationality of dominant platform strategies in a context of dynamic competition.
The article pursues a twofold goal. In part I, I review the core insights from Clayton Christensen’s work on disruptive innovation and show that there are relevant limitations on using these theories to support ex-ante predictions of market outcomes. In part II, I argue that insights from the theories of disruptive innovation might sometimes explain the rationale behind exclusionary practices. I provide two examples to illustrate this point. The first example comes from the Apple Store vs. Epic Games case in the U.S., while the second comes from the Brazilian antitrust case against iFood, Brazil’s largest online food delivery platform.

I. On the Normative Limits of Theories of Disruptive Innovation
In several areas other than antitrust, the popularity of Clayton Christensen’s writings have led to conceptual misunderstandings that make disruptions narratives artificially ubiquitous.5 As a result, rather than expanding the disruption approach to any succession of a new economic agent, theories of disruptive innovation describe more restricted phenomena.
In his early works, Christensen examined disk storage and computer processor markets to understand why some high-profile firms like IBM, Apple, and Xerox have failed to maintain their market leadership.6 These failures did not result from lousy management, but from wrong decisions when dealing with technological evolution within a given value network, understood as the context in which a company identifies and responds to customer needs.7
Christensen identified that leading firms tended to prioritize technology solutions that were less costly and allowed them to best serve their current customers with higher profit margins. These innovations, called “sustainable innovations,” improved the performance of established products along performance dimensions that key customers valued historically.
By prioritizing this type of innovation, however, incumbents ended up serving customers with products that were more expensive and technologically superior to what consumers themselves demanded in a historical trajectory.8 As a result, fringe consumers formed at the bottom of these markets who were either unwilling to pay for the technologically superior products provided by the incumbents or, even if they did purchase these products, felt they were not worth as much.
A careful understanding of these theoretical lessons makes the examination of dynamic competition between digital platforms even harder.
First, disruptions describe processes of resource allocation that occur over time, so it is inappropriate to claim that a given product or service is itself disruptive.  Disruption resides in the strategic choice to introduce the innovation in the market, not in the product’s technical attributes.
Second, disruptive innovation does not necessarily represent a threat to incumbents at the beginning. Instead, disruptions usually address low-end customers’ needs, or target new markets. These segments serve as true “footholds” so that the new entrant can focus on the fringe and, only after reaching some competitive quality level, attack the incumbents’ conventional consumer groups. For this reason, disruptive innovations are usually of lower quality at the beginning.
Third, and related to the previous point, superior technology does not define a disruptive innovation. Instead, its distinctive nature lies in how it addresses consumer preferences.  Because of this, even when a technology appears superior in its technical attributes, it may not represent a deviation from traditional demand preferences.9
All these theoretical aspects raise doubts about whether one can predict disruption outcomes. Moreover, Christensen’s work has been criticized for cherry-picking particular industries as examples.10 Although many studies have tried to develop ex-ante predictions, the results are mixed at best. A conservative way to assess the chances of disruption is to compare performance trajectories in the historical demand curve versus the trajectory of performance improvement supplied by the new technology.11 However, this analysis requires speculation on how demand varies along multiples dimensions for some product. Even if we could draw some inferences by looking at the customers’ past behavior, data on young technologies would be rarely available.

II. Assessing Single-firm Conduct Through the Lens of Innovation Disruption 
The normative limitations of theories of disruptive innovation do not mean that they are useless for antitrust. On the contrary, these theories might illuminate new ways of conceptualizing market power and comprehending exclusion incentives, not from a normative approach but from a descriptive one.
A) Identifying New Disruptors
First, antitrust authorities should try to correctly identify competitors that pose a real risk of market disruption. Traditional market definition methods are insufficient for measuring dominant platforms’ market power, and are unsatisfactory as a general method for assessing damages to competition within a given artificial space. Moreover, some market definitions cannot be taken in isolation.
Disruptive innovations, in that sense, do not meet the historical preferences of consolidated consumers. Whether in digital markets or any other, the factor suggesting the presence of a disruptor is a product that either addresses low-end customers or even constitutes a new market. For this reason, the examination of market shares or even of recent entries within some timeframe can be misguided. Face-to-face competition on core digital markets is often just one aspect of the various dimensions of the competitive process, as much of the competitive forces are directed to new markets or against non-consumption.12
Disruptive competition between digital platforms develops from what Pierre Laourche13 has rightly identified as competition “on” the market – not “for” or “in” the market. The author highlights that disruptive competitors want to shift the value network or replace the dominant architectural design to gain control of a competitive bottleneck. Therefore, “the prize is not so much some amount of profit in a competitive market, but a commanding market position that enables the firm to reap a far larger profit.”14
Assessing competition from a disruption approach requires looking for the decisions taken by current or potential challengers. More specifically, antitrust authorities should be vigilant with entrants’ strategies that suggest a discontinuation between the historical preference trajectory of consumers and the demand curve at the bottom of the existing market. Of course, future scenarios are uncertain. But some recent examples might demonstrate that competitors are trying to find alternative ways to address low-end customers, even in the face of consolidated digital platforms.
Despite Google’s strong dominance in the universal search engines market, it seems that competition against non-consumption comes from the way customers value the services’ other quality dimensions, such as privacy. As Google has become the target of antitrust investigations and increased regulatory scrutiny to protect users’ privacy, some start-ups with high venture capital like Neeva are betting on creating a search engine paid by subscription.15
In social networks, competitors also seem to be trying to run sideways. Despite Facebook’s long-established leadership, in the last decade we have seen significant entries from companies such as Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok.16 These players appear to have bet on disruptive or alternative strategies, like investing in relevant architectural innovations and sophisticated photo and video capabilities accessible to non-professional users.17 They do not reproduce the exact characteristics or the marginal increments of the incumbent social network, which has even led Facebook to adopt similar novelties to those brought by these entrants.
When defining a relevant market, antitrust authorities cannot ignore that potential disruptors are unwilling to address the mainstream preferences of traditional customers of the incumbent platforms. Thus, even when we do not see face-to-face competition in the present, incumbents might try to impede the success of challengers that may shift their value network.
B) Platform Responses to Disruptive Challengers
Second, theories of disruption can explain how digital platforms might have incentives not to respond to innovative threats imposed by new disruptors. Dominant agents can use vertical agreements, predatory practices, or abuses of intellectual property “to make the access to the lower end of the consumers more difficult and/or render the interface between its value network and another value network more difficult.”18
Of course, it is not a simple task to determine when single-firm conducts aimed at protecting their dominant position will be unlawful or not. Nevertheless, some insight shared in this article can inspire new theories of dominant platform harm with regard to exclusionary conducts.
The narratives of successful disruption cycles assume that consumers at the bottom of the market who are unwilling to pay for sustainable innovations biased by the incumbent’s historical trajectory can freely migrate or simultaneously adopt the new technology offered by the entrant. To prevent such migration from the value network, incumbents will seek to delay the migration or adoption of a new product.
 
III. Lessons from the Present – Epic v. Apple and Rappi v. iFood
While we cannot elaborate on all possible exclusion scenarios, it is interesting to look at two particular cases
First, take the ongoing battle between Epic Games and Apple in the U.S.19 As of August 2020, Epic Games launched a new direct payment system in their “Fortnite” game called “The Fortnite Mega Drop.” Epic Games’ primary goal in introducing this system was to prevent Apple Store from charging a 30 percent fee for each transaction between final customers and Epic Games. The new Epic Games payment system guaranteed permanent discounts on the game’s currency, V-Bucks. In response, Apple banned Epic Games from the Apple Store for violating its rules.20 Epic Games have argued that Apple engaged in unalwfull monopolization practices both in the IOS app distribution market and in the market for payment solutions.21
But how could antitrust agencies frame Epic Games v. Apple as a tale of disruption? First, consider that Apple historically imposes fees for in-app purchases. Thus, under some circumstances, we could see the introduction of Epic Games’ payment system as a disruptive attack to “capture” low-cost customers. Most users who make purchases in smartphone apps might value the support features provided by Apple’s App Store. People who own iPhones and iPads can make these payments using their own Apple Account valid for the entire Apple Ecosystem. Regular users can also make payments with a simple touch and secure personal identification system that involves the buyer’s face or fingerprint recognition. These features provided by Apple seem to be positively valued on the preference curve of consumers who are at the “top end of the markets.”
On the other hand, at the bottom of the market, big fans of the Fortnite game may not follow the same preference pattern. Fortnite players will probably not be willing to pay a higher price for V-Bucks just because the Apple Store brings greater convenience to transactions. While there is not enough data to elaborate on this point, one could imagine a case where demand curves show that V-bucks buyers do not give high value to parameters historically valued by most Apple Store users. In that case, Fortnite players would constitute a group of “low-cost” customers who might be a foothold for disruption.
If that is the case, Apple may be concerned not only about the free-rider effect provided by the Fortnite Mega Drop. The dominant firm may also fear a significant revolution in payment systems in general. If every highly-popular app creates its own payment system, app stores themselves may become obsolete as a medium to mediate payment between users and app developers. The likelihood of this market revolution depends on consumer behavior patterns, which should be closely examined.
Next, we look at a somewhat more obscure case, taking place in Brazil. In March 2021, Brazilian competition watchdog CADE issued an interim decision prohibiting iFood, Brazil’s most popular food delivery app, from signing exclusivity agreements with bars and restaurants.22 The investigation started after competitor Rappi filed a complaint in September of last year. Another competitor, Uber Eats, controlled by Uber Technologies Inc., also spoke against iFood’s exclusivity agreements. In addition, an association of bars and restaurants complained before the authority asserting that iFood’s bargaining power for exclusivity became stronger during the COVID-19 pandemic.23
In its decision, CADE considered that iFood holds a dominant position in the food delivery app market due to its large market share (around 86 percent according to the Brazilian Association of restaurants and bars).24 Moreover, CADE acknowledged that iFood benefits from a “first-mover” advantage, as it started as the first national food delivery app in the country.25
As this is an interim decision, the authority did not elaborate further on a theory of harm, but mentioned that exclusive agreements with restaurants might lead to market foreclosure and higher barriers to entry. CADE deemed these market harms were imminent once the COVID-19 pandemic enormously boosted the food delivery market.
One of the central defensive claims put forth by iFood is that interim measures are misplaced as the national food app market is highly dynamic and subject to significant risks of disruption. However, even though this is a digital platform market, there seems to be little evidence of threats of market disruption anytime soon.
On the one hand, we could try to assert that iFood is a legitimate incumbent. The firm developed a new business model when apps did not seem to be a very reliable business partner for restaurants. iFood only started to face competition from other national platforms (as Aiqfome, 99 Food, Delivery Much, Uber Eats, and Rappi) in Brazil’s medium-sized cities over the last two years.
But it is not so simple to state that the new entrants shall be “disruptors” in the market. Most of iFood’s competitors seem to represent face-to-face competition instead. Others seem to be betting on differentiated business models that are even more sophisticated and do not seem to address “low-end customers.” Rappi, for example, offers various forms of delivery service – not only food-related. The platform’s partner portfolio is much more pluralist, including supermarkets, drugstores, and specialized retail stores. The platform even offers personalized deliveries of virtually anything. On the other hand, Uber Eats exploits a strong brand name in logistics and its high reputation among drivers. In both cases, however, there is no clear sign of competition outside the value network.
As there is little room for framing the case under a dynamic competition approach, CADE will probably assess the practice under its traditional legal criteria for exclusionary practices as developed in the case law. The authority will evaluate whether the alleged efficiencies of the practice, namely the potential for avoiding free-rider effects, can overcome these concrete and potential exclusionary effects.
 
IV. Final Remarks 
These are just a few examples of how disruptive innovation theories can rewrite (or not) the checklist of exclusionary abuses. For all the reasons set above, this brief article attempts to show the importance of advancing a research agenda that firmly grasps the core insights of theories of disruptive innovations in order to strengthen the antitrust analysis.

783,"August 2, 2021",Musk Sides With Epic In Battle Over Apple App Store Fees,"


Elon Musk has thrown his hat in the ring in the ongoing legal battle between tech giant Appleand Epic Games, which makes the ultra-popular Fortnite game, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) wrote.
“Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet,” the Tesla chief executive tweeted Friday, July 30. “Epic is right.”
The lawsuit stems from Epic’s decision to circumvent Apple’s in-app payment system to put out its own way for users to pay.
As Apple deemed this to be a violation of its policies, it banned Epic from its App Store and has since been engaged in the lawsuit filed by Epic over the matter.
Epic has accused Apple of possessing a “monopolistic” hold over its field, as the App Store is the primary way for many users to buy new apps. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, in a federal trial ending in May, has said Apple unfairly profits from the work of those who make video games.
In response, Apple has defended its actions, saying that the lawsuit was a “basic disagreement over money” from Epic’s side. The company said its taking of 30%t of profits is necessary for putting that toward making sure the App Store provides a generally safe way for users to download apps.
Musk has often stirred the pot on social media, including criticizing rivals like Amazon. WSJ reports that he has recently seemed to praise the US Government Accountability Office for rejecting appeals to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin space travel company over a contract to develop a lunar lander.

Apple has defeated email app maker Blix’s claims in Delaware federal court that it uses its “Sign In With Apple” single sign-on (SSO) feature to stifle competition from it and other app makers.
US District Judge Leonard Stark on Friday, July 9, dismissed Blix’s third complaint in the case with prejudice for failing to show that an Apple policy requiring developers to offer the feature when they offer any SSOs on its iOS mobile operating system restricted competition, finalizing Apple’s win after two earlier rulings in its favor.
“This case demonstrates that Apple has consistently acted legally by introducing its own innovative products and features that promote competition,” an Apple spokesperson wrote in a Monday email, calling Blix a “frequent complainer to press and regulators” that had raised “false conspiracy theories and anti-competitive claims.”
Blix and its attorneys Daniel Melman of Pearl Cohen Zedek Latzer Baratz, Mark Rifkin of Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz, and John Day and Andrew Mayo of Ashby & Geddes didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Apple’s attorneys Daniel Swanson of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and David Moore of Potter Anderson & Corroon.

785,"July 11, 2021",Australia Moves Epic Games Antitrust Lawsuit Against Apple Forward,"


The antitrust lawsuit initiated by Epic Games against Apple was given the green light to move forward by the court in Australia in a ruling that overturned the original decision to put the case on hold, 9 to 5 Mac reported on Friday (July 9).
Apple originally blocked the Australian suit, maintaining that the issue was previously decided in the US courts. It’s anticipated that Apple will try to have this new decision by the Australian courts overturned as well. 
Epic Games has accused Apple of having a monopoly advantage over iOS apps and further charged that the iPhone maker leveraged that power for its own gain and sidestepped competition, the news outlet reported. 
The digital gaming company — which is the creator of the popular and iconic online video game Fortnite — pointed to specifics that developers have no choice but to pay Apple a commission as high as 30 percent. Apple also doesn’t allow app platforms to use alternative payment methods nor does it communicate to users that there are other avenues to get a subscription, according to 9 to 5 Mac.
Epic Games already filed a US suit against Apple in November of last year with both companies weighing in, but the case has yet to be decided. The gaming platform launched its case in Australia last November stating that Apple abuses its market power and further curtails competition relating to app distribution and payments.
Ahead of the US antitrust lawsuit in April, both companies laid out their arguments separately to the court. Epic Games had been pursuing a legal disagreement with Apple that started last year. Epic had tried then to find a workaround to Apple’s high commission fees. Apple moved to remove Fortnite from its App Store. The Australian lawsuit launched by Epic against Apple was initiated in March.

Apple is reportedly furthering its early discussions with the NFL about getting the rights to stream Sunday football games, 9to5 Mac reported on Friday (July 9), citing a report from the Information.
The NFL package offered by DirecTV is being nixed and the company is surrendering its streaming rights following the football season in 2022. Apple has been in discussions with the NFL to get hold of the Sunday Ticket rights.
The talks with the NFL follow Apple’s hiring last year of Amazon executive James DeLorenzo to lead sports for Apple TV+. DeLorenzo was responsible for working out a deal to grant Amazon streaming rights to some live NFL football games.
DirecTV reportedly shells out some $1.5 billion a year for Sunday Ticket rights. It is anticipated that the NFL will charge more than that for the next buyer looking for streaming rights. Holding on to the rights is said to cost DirecTV as much as $2.5 billion.
If Apple does get the rights to the Sunday Ticket, it would expand the audience for Apple TV+ and also would be a complement to NFL games on legacy television networks as well as to the games shown on Amazon.
Sunday Ticket streams NFL games that are not typically available on local broadcast television channels. The service appeals to fans living or working outside of their favorite team’s distribution. It also is an attractive service to bars and restaurants catering to football fans loyal to games outside of their region.
Apple CEO Tim Cook and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell are anticipated to discuss the matter at the Sun Valley media conference, 9 to 5 Mac reported.

787,"July 11, 2021",Apple Will Appeal Russian Antitrust Fine In September ,"


Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service has agreed to delay an appeal hearing over a $12 million fine, following a request from Apple for more time to prepare.
In August 2020, the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) ruled that Apple’s App Store gives Apple an unfair advantage in the digital app economy. As a result, Apple was fined $12 million by the court.
According to Sputnik News, Apple’s request to cancel the fine was reviewed by the FAS. No details have been revealed of the FAS’s review, but Apple has been informed and consequently requested a delay so it has time to prepare its response.
The Russian appeals court agreed to put off the hearing until September.
The antitrust case and $12 million fine resulted from a complaint by Kaspersky Lab in 2019. The company accused Apple of forcing it to reduce the functionality of its Safe Kids app after Apple introduced a competing product called Screen Time in iOS 12.

Apple has been warned by the European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager, not to use privacy and security concerns as a shield for anticompetitive behavior. In an interview with Reuters, Vestager said that while she shares Apple’s concerns about privacy and security, competition is just as important.
Vestager’s comments come after Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke out against the proposed Digital Markets Act in Europe, which was first unveiled last December. According to Cook, this legislation could lead to changes that seriously “destroy the security of the iPhone.”
Speaking to Reuters today, Vestager explained that she does not believe customers will be giving up privacy or security if they sideload: “think privacy and security is of paramount importance to everyone. The important thing here is, of course, that it’s not a shield against competition, because I think customers will not give up neither security nor privacy if they use another app store or if they sideload,” she said.
Among other things, the proposed Digital Markets Act in Europe could lead to major changes for the App Store and pre-installed first-party applications on the iPhone.
It would also force Apple to allow side-loading on the iPhone, which is something Cook strongly pushes back against. If Apple had to allow side-loading, Cook said last month, then features like App Store nutrition labels and App Tracking Transparency “would not exist anymore.”

Microsoft comes under pressure as software suppliers raise market abuse complaints with the European Commission over bundling of Defender security software with Windows.
Security technology suppliers have complained to European Union officials over Microsoft’s alleged abuse of its dominant market position in Europe, according to official EU sources.
A high-level EU official from the European Commission competition directorate said at least three security software companies had “met several times” with the EC to raise alleged market abuses by Microsoft.
The complaints centre on Microsoft’s free security software add-on, Defender, included by default in the Windows 10 operating system. Security companies claim the tactic is shrinking the market for competing security software.

Google Android after Microsoft: some thoughts on the proceedings brought against Google for abuse of a dominant position
By Giulia Funghi & Alessandro Rosanò (University of Padua)
Abstract:     In April 2015 the European Commission opened an antitrust proceedings against Google with regard to its business practices related to Android, the famous smarthpone and tablet operating system. According to the Commission, Google has abused of its dominant position in that it has allegedly required or incentivised smartphone and tablet manufacturers to exclusively pre-install Google’s own applications or services, prevented smartphone and tablet manufacturers from developing and marketing modified and potentially competing versions of Android, tied or bundled certain Google applications and services distributed on Android devices with other Google applications, services, and/or application programming interfaces of Google. The purpose of the article is to find a solution to the case in light of the judgment passed by the Court of First Instance of the European Union in Microsoft and show that Google’s business practice does not amount to a violation of competition rules in that it protects both consumers and free competition.

793,"December 6, 2016",EU: Microsoft $26 billion LinkedIn buy approved with light conditions,"
The European Union on Tuesday approved Microsoft’s $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn, after the software giant agreed to safeguards to assuage antitrust concerns.
The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, said it was clearing the deal on the condition that, postmerger, Microsoft allowed other professional networking sites access to programming commands for its Office applications and cloud-computing services for the next five years. It must also grant computer manufacturers the option not to install the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the EU said.
“A growing number of Europeans subscribe to professional social networks. Today’s decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,” said EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager.
The concessions are mild. Microsoft already offers its Office Add-in program to professional social-networking services. Giving rivals access to its cloud-computing system could ultimately benefit Microsoft, because companies that took advantage of that system would use Microsoft products to do so. Moreover, LinkedIn has become the dominant professional social network without help from Microsoft’s desktop, counting 467 million members in its most recent quarter, up 18% from a year earlier.

There’s at least one company that’s not too happy that Microsoft has received European Union approval for its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn: Microsoft’s rival Salesforce.
Salesforce had been protesting to the EU about the deal, hoping that the EU would force Microsoft into promising that it would keep access to LinkedIn’s treasure trove of data open to all competitors.
The EU did extract a rather lengthy list of concessions from Microsoft, but not about LinkedIn’s data. The list centered on things like making Microsoft promise not to use its market position with Windows and MS Office to squash other social networks.
Salesforce, which tried to buy LinkedIn itself, is now warning that regulators will have to watch Microsoft closely and hints that if Microsoft does close access to LinkedIn’s data, Salesforce won’t accept the situation silently.

800,"January 9, 2022",India Goes After Google Over News Publications,"


India’s competition watchdog on Friday, January 7, ordered an investigation into Alphabet’s Google following allegations from news publishers, stating its initial view was that the tech giant had broken some antitrust laws.
In its order, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) stated Google dominates certain online search services in the country and may have imposed unfair conditions on news publishers, reported Reuters.
The complainant, Digital News Publishers Association, which comprises the digital arms of some of India’s biggest media companies, stated Google denied fair advertising revenue to its members.
“In a well-functioning democracy, the critical role played by news media cannot be undermined,” the CCI order stated. “It appears that Google is using its dominant position in the relevant markets to enter/protect its position in the market for news aggregation service.”
News organizations, which have been losing advertising revenue to online aggregators such as Google, have complained for years about tech companies using stories in search results or other features without payment.
The CCI order also mentioned new rules in France and Australia – fueled by media lobbying and public pressure – that have led to licensing deals around the world collectively worth billions of dollars.

According to Reuters, France’s data privacy watchdog CNIL has fined Alphabet’s Google a record 150 million euros ($169 million) for making it difficult for internet users to refuse online trackers known as cookies.
Facebook was also fined 60 million euros for the same reason, the CNIL said.
Internet users’ prior consent for the use of cookies — tiny snippets of data that help build targeted digital ad campaigns — is a key pillar of the European Union’s data privacy regulation and a top priority for the CNIL.
“When you accept cookies, it’s done in just one click,” said Karin Kiefer, CNIL’s head for data protection and sanctions. “Rejecting cookies should be as easy as accepting them”.
In its statement, the watchdog said it had found that the facebook.com, google.fr and youtube.com websites didn’t allow the refusal of cookies easily, citing Google’s video-streaming platform.
The CNIL said the two companies had three months to comply with its orders or face an extra penalty payment of 100,000 euros per day of delay.
These include the obligation for Google and Facebook to provide French internet users simpler tools for refusing cookies, in order to guarantee their consent.
The CNIL said that while Google and Facebook provided a virtual button to allow the immediate acceptance of cookies, there was no equivalent to refuse them as easily.
“People trust us to respect their right to privacy and keep them safe. We understand our responsibility to protect that trust and are committing to further changes and active work with the CNIL in light of this decision,” a Google spokesperson said. France Google Facebook Fine
CNIL’s previous record fine in 2020 also targeted Google and amounted to 100 million euros.

With its judgment of 10th November 2021, Europe’s General Court did not just dismiss Google’s appeal against the European Commission’s Google Search (Shopping) decision, uphold the fine, tell gatekeepers “don’t be evil,” and remind everyone that Europe ensures equal opportunities. The Court also rectified all of Google’s misrepresentations of the challenged Commission decision. By doing so, the judgment deprives the mechanisms that Google chose to implement the remedy imposed by the Commission of its conceptual foundation. Google will need to change the way it treats competing specialised search services fundamentally. The article summarises how the judgment withdraws the basis of Google’s so called Compliance Mechanism, what the required equal access to Google’s general results pages presupposes and what this means for affected specialised search services.

805,"January 5, 2022",Google In German Watchdog Crosshairs,"


Germany’s antitrust watchdog paved the way Wednesday, January 5, for extra scrutiny of Google by designating it a company of “paramount significance,” the first to get that label since regulators got more power to curb abusive practices by big digital companies.
The Bundeskartellamt stated its decision comes after rules were introduced last year that allow it “to intervene earlier and more effectively” to ban companies from using anti-competitive practices. The regulator’s decision, which lasts five years, gives it extended powers to supervise Google for “abuse control.”
The watchdog stated Google has “significant influence” over other companies’ access to its users and advertising customers through search, YouTube, Android, and its online Play Store “and can set rules and conditions for other businesses across markets.”
It’s the latest example of how big tech companies are facing pressure over concerns their dominance stifles competition and hurts consumers. Europe has led the global move to crack down on tech giants, but early efforts drew criticism that investigations took too long, with some stretching on for years — a problem the German rules aim to address.
“This is a very important step, since based on this decision, the Bundeskartellamt can now take action against specific anti-competitive practices by Google,” said the watchdog’s president, Andreas Mundt.
Google is not appealing the decision. It noted the decision doesn’t take a position on the company’s conduct.
“We are confident that we comply with the rules and, to the extent that changes are necessary, we will continue to work constructively with the (Federal Cartel Office) to find solutions that enable people and businesses in Germany to continue to use our products,” Google said in a statement.

806,"January 5, 2022",Sen. Warren & Rep. Jayapal Want Google To Stop Asking For DOJ’s Kanter Recusal,"


Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Pramila Jayapa told Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Wednesday, January 5, to stop trying to “bully” Department of Justice (DOJ) antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter into recusal, they shared with CNBC.
“Google should focus on complying with antitrust law rather than attempting to rig the system with these unseemly tactics,” the lawmakers wrote.
Following Kanter’s confirmation in the Senate in November, Google requested the DOJ review whether he should be recused from cases and investigations involving its business. Google cited Kanter’s prior work for its rivals like Yelp in antitrust matters involving its business, and pointed to previous statements about Google’s alleged dominance to argue he’d already made up his mind on its liability.Related: Google Seeks Recusal From Kantner Over Yelp & Microsoft Cases
Kanter has not committed to recusing himself from matters involving Google, but told lawmakers ahead of his confirmation that he would consult DOJ ethics officials about whether he should do so. A recusal would bar Kanter from involvement in the department’s ongoing antitrust lawsuit against Google and likely any future investigations, though responsibility would fall to his deputies.
Warren and Jayapal wrote that Google’s argument “distorts federal ethics requirements, improperly claiming that because Mr. Kanter has worked to enforce antitrust law against Google in the past, he cannot do so on behalf of the federal government now.”They wrote that under federal ethics law and regulations, recusal is required when a person has a financial interest involving certain parties, worked for an employer or client in the past two years that is a party in a particular matter, or would be deemed potentially impartial by a reasonable person with the relevant facts.
The Democrats said that since Kanter has not represented Google or the US, the two parties that would be named in any federal lawsuit against Google, that should not be a basis for his recusal.

A group of 30 newspaper publishers, including Seattle-based Robinson Newspapers, have sued Google and Facebook over the way the social and search giants profit from news content at the expense of the publications that produce it.
The lawsuits, outlined in a story by Axios, involve more than 200 individual publications and are based on a central antitrust premise: that the two tech companies are so pervasive in online advertising that they illegally siphon up revenue that would otherwise go to local news.
The litigation’s goal, according to the Axios report, is “to recover past damages to newspapers” caused by Big Tech companies, according to a lawyer representing the newspapers.
Filed in September, the Robinson lawsuit blames the two tech companies for a sharp decline in revenue. “Defendants’ anticompetitive and monopolistic practices have had a profound effect upon our country’s free and diverse press, particularly the newspaper industry,” the lawsuit states.
“Since 2006, newspaper advertising revenue, which is critical for funding high-quality journalism, fell by over 50%.”

Russia fined Google 9 million roubles ($121,000), a Moscow court said on Tuesday, in the latest in a string of penalties against the technology giant for failing to delete content the government deems illegal, reported Reuters. 
Moscow has increased pressure on foreign tech companies this year in a campaign that critics characterize as an attempt by the authorities to exert tighter control over the Internet, something they say threatens to stifle individual and corporate freedom.
Google and Meta Platforms both face court cases this month for repeated violations of Russian legislation on content and could be fined a percentage of their annual revenue in Russia. 
Moscow’s Tagansky District Court on Tuesday said Google had been fined a total of 9 million roubles in three separate administrative cases for not deleting content.
The court cited legislation which said this may include posts containing extremist activities, child pornography or the promotion of drug use.
Google has paid more than 32 million roubles in fines this year and has significantly reduced the number of posts prohibited by Moscow, the company and Russia have said.

By: Pablo Ibañez Colomo (Chilling Competition)
The General Court’s judgment in Google Shopping (available here) is finally out. There is much to unpack, and much that will be debated in the coming days and weeks. In this regard: the Journal of European Competition Law & Practice is planning a Special Issue devoted to the judgment. More details will follow in due course, but we will be open to proposed submissions, as we want to make sure that the issue is as balanced and diverse as possible.
The above said, it is immediately possible to get a clear idea of the logic underpinning the judgment. It is remarkable in a number of ways, which, if appealed and confirmed by the Court of Justice, may lead to a substantial expansion of the scope of Article 102 TFEU.
The rationale behind the judgment can be summarised as follows:
The General Court’s develops a principle of equal treatment, which is inferred from the case law applicable to public undertakings (and public bodies) and is now expanded to other dominant firms (para 155).There is an element of ‘abnormality’ in the differential treatment of a search engine’s affiliated services, on the one hand, and third party ones, on the other (paras 176, 179 and 616).Google’s search engine is a ‘quasi-essential facility’; in any event, it is not necessary to establish that the platform is indispensable within the meaning of the Bronner case law.
Equal treatment, abnormality and competition on the merits
When reading the judgment, one cannot avoid the impression that the General Court viewed the practice at stake in the case as inherently suspicious, that is, as a departure, by its very nature, from competition on the merits. To quote the judgment itself: ‘the promotion on Google’s general results pages of one type of specialised result – its own – over the specialised results of competitors involves a certain form of abnormality‘ (para 176).
The judgment concludes that the behaviour at stake is ‘abnormal’ for two separate reasons…

Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota says the US Department of Justice should investigate Amazon’s US$8.45 billion purchase of MGM over antitrust concerns,reported Variety.
“This is a major acquisition that has the potential to impact millions of consumers,” she said Thursday, May 27. “The Department of Justice must conduct a thorough investigation to ensure that this deal won’t risk harming competition.”
Klobuchar’s call for an investigation comes the day after Amazon announced plans to buy the parent company of MGM Studios, a decades-old studio that is home to some of the world’s most popular and beloved films and shows. MGM’s extensive library of more than 4,000 films and 17,000 TV shows could give Amazon an edge in its fight to compete with other streaming competitors like Netflix and Disney+.
Concern over Amazon’s deal with MGM appears to be a bipartisan issue, with several Republicans also voicing disapproval of the sale due to anticompetitive business concerns.
Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri tweeted on Wednesday that the “sale should not go through. @amazon is already a monopoly platform that owns e-commerce, shipping, grocers & the cloud. They shouldn’t be permitted to buy anything else. Period.”
“This is also a reminder of why we need to fund our antitrust agencies so they can take on investigations of multi-billion dollar deals,” Klobuchar, who chairs the antitrust subcommittee, added. “Our government cannot ensure major corporations are playing by the rules if enforcement agencies are chronically underfunded. My bipartisan legislation, which recently passed through the Judiciary Committee, would give the antitrust agencies additional resources to conduct rigorous reviews of large mergers.”

811,"May 30, 2021",Other States May Follow DC’s Actions Against Amazon,"


Antitrust clouds are gathering over Amazon in a week that saw the retail giant face its first US lawsuit alleging competition-squelching practices just before the company announced its second-biggest acquisition ever.
Washington, DC, filed a suit  against the US’ largest online seller Tuesday, May 25, accusing Amazon of monopolistic behavior. The suit claims the e-commerce giant’s dominance allows it to impose onerous terms on third-party sellers on its platform that drive up prices for online shoppers everywhere.
Now, other state enforcers are examining Amazon for potential violations, according to Bloomberg. Attorneys general in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania are looking at Amazon’s practices, the outlet reported, citing anonymous people familiar with the matter.
Karl Racine, the DC attorney general, told reporters on Tuesday he had not coordinated with federal regulators on the suit. He said at the time he didn’t know if other states would join or support the district’s suit, while noting it was “not unusual” for that to happen.
Amazon is already facing antitrust scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission as well as the attorneys general of New York and California, after a House subcommittee issued a scathing report on the retailer’s practices late last year.

812,"May 27, 2021", More State Attorney Generals Join Amazon Antitrust Probe,"


The attorneys general from Pennsylvania and Massachusetts have joined a list of officials investigating Amazon for antitrust violations, Bloomberg reported Thursday, May 27, citing sources.
The list already includes California, New York, Washington state, and the Federal Trade Commission, meaning “that the eCommerce giant will be fighting a multifront legal war in the months ahead,” per the news outlet.
Sources told Bloomberg that prosecutors in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania are speaking with their counterparts in New York and California on how to divide the workload, while the AG in Washington — Amazon’s homebase — has collaborated with California.
“The ultimate aim is to build a viable antitrust case against the world’s largest online retailer, said one of the people, who requested anonymity because the probes aren’t public,” Bloomberg reported, adding that Connecticut’s attorney general has also started looking into the business practices of Amazon.
The case stems from the accusation that Amazon uses its market power to overpower its rivals and compete against third-party merchants who pay to sell on its platform, along with other alleged anti-competitive practices.
Attorneys general in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania declined to comment for the Bloomberg story, while an Amazon spokesman simply pointed to a previous statement, saying “the presumption that success can only be the result of anti-competitive behavior is simply wrong.”
The news comes two days after the attorney general of Washington, DC, filed a lawsuit against Amazon accusing the company of anti-competitive practices.
“Amazon has used its dominant position in the online retail market to win at all costs. It maximizes its profits at the expense of third-party sellers and consumers, while harming competition, stifling innovation, and illegally tilting the playing field in its favor,” Washington, DC, Attorney General Karl Racine said in a news release.
“We filed this antitrust lawsuit to put an end to Amazon’s illegal control of prices across the online retail market. We need a fair online marketplace that expands options available to District residents and promotes competition, innovation, and choice.”

813,"May 26, 2021",Amazon Will Buy MGM Studios For $6.5B,"


Amazon announced that it has agreed to acquire Hollywood studio MGM, a deal the e-commerce giant is betting can jump-start its Prime Video streaming platform and position it to compete with industry heavyweights including Netflix and Walt Disney, reported The Wall Street Journal.
The purchase, which was unveiled Wednesday morning, May 26, has an equity value of US$6.5 billion, people familiar with the matter said. Including debt, the value of the deal is US$8.45 billion, Amazon stated. It is the second-largest acquisition in the company’s history behind its US$13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017.
In MGM, Amazon will gain a library of over 4,000 films, including iconic franchises such as “James Bond” and “Rocky,” and classics such as “The Silence of the Lambs,” “Raging Bull,” and “12 Angry Men.” The TV catalog includes critically acclaimed shows such as “The Handmaid’s Tale,” “Fargo,” and “Vikings.”
Amazon’s deal for MGM is the latest in a series of mergers that are shaking the entertainment industry as media and tech companies fight for supremacy in the streaming age.

814,"May 25, 2021",The Big Deal in Amazon’s Antitrust Case,"


By Shira Ovide, New York Times
Hoo boy, this is a moment. A government authority in the United States has sued Amazon over claims that the company is breaking the law by unfairly crushing competition.
The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday by the attorney general for the District of Columbia, joins the recent government antitrust cases against Google and Facebook. These lawsuits will take forever, and legal experts have said that the companies likely have the upper hand in court.
The D.C. attorney general, Karl Racine, however, is making a legal argument against Amazon that is both old-school and novel, and it might become a blueprint for crimping Big Tech power.

815,"May 25, 2021",DC Attorney General Sues Amazon On Antitrust Grounds,"
Washington, DC, Attorney General Karl Racine announced Tuesday, May 25, that he’s suing Amazon on antitrust grounds, alleging the company’s practices have unfairly raised prices for consumers and suppressed innovation, reported CNBC.
Racine is seeking to end what he alleges is Amazon’s illegal use of price agreements to edge out competition; the lawsuit also asks for damages and penalties to deter similar conduct. The suit asks the court to stop what it calls Amazon’s ability to harm competition through a variety of remedies as needed, which could include structural relief, often referred to as a form of breakup.
The lawsuit, filed in DC Superior Court, alleges Amazon illegally maintained monopoly power by using contract provisions to prevent third-party sellers on its platform from offering their products for lower prices on other platforms. The attorney general’s office claimed the contracts create “an artificially high price floor across the online retail marketplace,” according to a press release. The AG claimed these agreements ultimately harm both consumers and third-party sellers by reducing competition, innovation and choice.
Amazon requires third-party sellers who want to do business on the online marketplace to abide by its business solutions agreement. Until 2019, Amazon included a clause in that document, referred to as a “price parity provision,” which prohibited sellers from offering their products on a competitor’s online marketplace at a lower price than what their products sold for on Amazon. 
Amazon quietly removed that provision in March 2019 amid growing antitrust scrutiny.
According to the complaint, even after Amazon removed the pricing parity provision from its agreement with third-party sellers, it added a nearly identical clause, referred to as its “fair pricing policy.” The fair pricing policy enables Amazon to “impose sanctions” on a seller that offers their product for a lower price on a competing online marketplace.
In an interview Tuesday on CNBC’s “The Exchange,” Racine said Amazon pulled a “bait and switch” with the pricing clauses in response to pressure from Congress.

816,"May 24, 2021",Amazon Nears Deal To Buy MGM Studios For $9B,"


Amazon is nearing a deal to acquire MGM Studios, the co-owner of the James Bond franchise and other film and TV series, for between US$8.5 billion and US$9 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
The deal is expected to be announced as soon as Tuesday, May 25. The people asked not to be named because the talks are private.
It would mark Amazon’s biggest acquisition since it bought Whole Foods in 2017 for US$13.7 billion.
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Monday that the deal could be announced this week.
Amazon is interested in acquiring more TV and film content for its Prime Video service as it competes with Netflix, Disney, and other streaming video services. MGM is a natural fit for any streaming service because of its plethora of content.
MGM, which is a private company, has been seeking a buyer for several years. Its owners include Anchorage Capital, Highland Capital Partners, Davidson, Kempner Capital Management, Solus Alternative Asset Management, and Owl Creek Investments — funds that took control of the studio when it emerged from bankruptcy in 2010.
MGM owns a number of famed movie and TV franchises, including Rocky, Legally Blonde, The Pink Panther, and Stargate. It also owns a studio, which has made more current hit TV shows, including “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “Fargo.”
MGM owns a number of popular reality TV shows, including “Shark Tank,” “Survivor,” “The Real Housewives,” series and “The Voice.”

817,"May 18, 2021",German Watchdog Starts Proceedings Against Amazon,"


Germany’s antitrust watchdog announced on Tuesday, May 18, it has launched a new investigation into whether US ecommerce giant Amazon is exploiting its market dominance, reported Reuters.
“In a first step, we are looking at whether Amazon is of outstanding, cross-market importance for competition,” the Federal Cartel Office announced in a statement.
Should it find that such a marketing position exists, new rules for digital companies would allow it to prohibit any anti-competitive behavior at an earlier stage, the watchdog stated.
Changes to Germany’s antitrust laws for digital corporations, which came into effect earlier this year, give the Cartel Office more power in identifying and prohibiting some companies’ dominant positions.
The Bonn-based authority has already initiated proceedings against Amazon’s price control mechanisms and relationships with third-party traders selling on its site.

The English Premier League has announced that it has agreed in principle to roll over its £5 billion (US$7 billion) deal with Sky, Amazon, and BT Sport for UK rights to the prestigious soccer competition.
The deal, which has been endorsed by the UK government to ward off an antitrust investigation, means that Sky, Amazon, and BT Sport will continue to broadcast the Premier League live until 2025. The BBC will also continue to show non-live highlights on Match Of The Day.
Rolling over the contracts means that the rights have not been put up for auction, preventing new entrants from bidding. There were reports that DAZN, the streamer run by former Disney executive Kevin Mayer, was interested in bidding after it recently beat Sky to Serie A rights in Italy.
There were concerns that an auction would have resulted in a deal valued at less than the £5 billion achieved in 2018, which would have been problematic for Premier League clubs after their matchday revenue has taken a huge hit during the coronavirus pandemic.
Premier League CEO Richard Masters said, “We are hugely appreciative of the Government agreeing in principle to allow this arrangement and for their continued support for the Premier League and the English game. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on football, and renewals with our UK broadcast partners will reduce uncertainty, generate stability and promote confidence within the football pyramid.”

819,"May 12, 2021",Amazon Wins Appeal Over $300M EU Tax Bill,"


Amazon struck a new blow to European Union efforts to wring more tax from big tech companies when the bloc’s second-highest court sided with the company over a US$300 million tax bill, reported The Wall Street Journal.
The EU court on Wednesday, May 12, annulled a 2017 decision from the European Commission, the EU’s top antitrust authority, that had ordered Amazon to pay €250 million in taxes to Luxembourg, the latest of several big EU tax decisions to be overturned.
In its decision, the court backed Amazon, saying that EU regulators had failed to prove that the company got an illegal advantage from tax rulings issued by Luxembourg, and saying that the Commission’s analysis had been “incorrect in several respects.”
Amazon stated it welcomed the decision, “which is in line with our long-standing position that we followed all applicable laws and that Amazon received no special treatment.”
The ruling is a significant blow to Margrethe Vestager, an executive vice president of the Commission who is leading a campaign to curb alleged excesses by some of the world’s largest tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, and Alphabe’s Google.
Ms. Vestager had already been rebuked once by the same court in a similar case. The General Court overturned her 2016 order that Ireland must recoup some €13 billion in taxes from Apple. Ms. Vestager has since appealed that case to the Court of Justice, the EU’s top court.

820,"March 11, 2021",Facebook Offers Content Creators New Ways To Monetize,"


Facebook has unveiled three new ways content creators can monetize the work they share on the social media platform.
“Content creators — digipubs, video creators, gaming creators, media companies, cultural institutions, businesses of all sizes and more — build vibrant communities on Facebook,” the company wrote in a blog post on Thursday, March 11. “We want them to have the tools and support they need to earn money and thrive, whether creating and sharing content is a primary business, one of many revenue streams, or a lifeline that’s kept their business afloat during the pandemic.”
To that end, Facebook will now let content creators earn money in new ways. Content creators can generate revenue from all types of video, including short-form. Monetization is now open to more creators, as Facebook has updated its in-stream ad eligibility, opening the program to more creators and offering access to in-stream ads for Live and expanding paid online events and fan subscriptions to new countries. In addition, Facebook is making it simpler for content creators to access fan support while boosting consumer adoption through free Stars giveaways for viewers.
In the next few weeks, Facebook will test the ability for content creators to monetize Facebook Stories with ads that look like stickers, giving the creators a cut of the revenue. The initial test grouping will be small but hopefully expanded to more creators and to short-form videos.

821,"March 10, 2021",Facebook Looks To Have Its Antitrust Suits Dismissed,"


Facebook has asked a court to dismiss state and federal antitrust lawsuits that accuse it of abusing its market power in social networking to crush smaller competitors, reported The Wall Street Journal.
The social media giant stated Wednesday, March 10, that the complaints “do not credibly claim” that its conduct harmed either consumers or market competition. 
The antitrust suits, filed in December by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 48 states, are seeking remedies that could include a forced spinoff of the social network’s popular Instagram and WhatsApp services.
“As we said when the FTC and the state attorneys general announced these lawsuits, people around the world use our products not because they have to, but because we make their lives better,” Facebook said in a statement.
The FTC suit asserts that Facebook has engaged in a “systematic strategy” to eliminate its competition, including by purchasing smaller up-and-coming rivals like Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. New York Attorney General Letitia James, in announcing the states complaint, echoed this sentiment, saying that Facebook “used its monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuff out competition, all at the expense of everyday users.”
The FTC previously allowed Facebook to make those acquisitions, but argues that time has shown that the company has used the deals to entrench a monopoly position. The states argue that a lack of competitors to Facebook has led to consumer harm, including by weakening privacy protections.
Facebook will have to meet a high legal standard to convince a federal judge to throw out the cases before trial. In order to prevail on a motion to dismiss, the company must show that the plaintiffs’ factual allegations about the nature of the marketplace, even if accepted as true, don’t establish a valid legal claim.

Reliance Industries, India’s largest company by market value, is looking to link up with Facebook and Google in a bid to get a digital payments license from the Reserve Bank of India to serve the country’s growing eCommerce market. The move would also include homegrown technology service provider Infibeam Avenues, Bloomberg reported.
The Reliance conglomerate is run by Mukesh Ambani, currently Asia’s wealthiest individual. Facebook and Google are among Reliance’s 13 international investors. According to Bloomberg sources, the four business partners are working on a detailed plan. The companies declined to comment.
Tufts University’s Fletcher School, in collaboration with Mastercard, released a report last month that assessed countries’ movement toward digital payments. India was fourth in “momentum” among 90 economies ranked at the end of last year. According to Fletcher’s Digital Evolution Scorecard, India takes its place among “break out economies,” which are “lower scoring in their present states of digitization” but changing quickly. The study added that such economies are “highly attractive to innovators and investors.”
Reliance’s Jio is a telecommunications company headquartered in Mumbai. It topped 405 million subscribers in the third quarter of last year. The startup, founded by Ambani, also saw a net increase in profits of 12.85% on a quarter-by-quarter basis.

Facebook announced Wednesday, February 24, that it plans to spend at least US$1 billion in the news industry over the next three years.
The announcement comes just days after a heated debate with the Australian government over how much Facebook should pay news publishers for content.
“We’ve invested $600 million since 2018 to support the news industry, and plan at least $1 billion more over the next three years,” Nick Clegg, vice president of global affairs at Facebook, wrote in a blog published Wednesday.
“Facebook is more than willing to partner with news publishers,” added Clegg. “We absolutely recognize quality journalism is at the heart of how open societies function — informing and empowering citizens and holding the powerful to account.”
Last month, Facebook announced deals with a number of publishers in the UK, including The Guardian, Telegraph Media Group, Financial Times, Daily Mail Group, and Sky News. As a result, the publishers will see their content featured in Facebook News, which is a dedicated section within the Facebook app that features curated and personalized news from hundreds of national, local, and lifestyle publications.

The privacy regulator overseeing Facebook and Google and Apple in the European Union expects to boost its tally of big tech decisions this year—and rejects complaints that its enforcement has been too slow, reported The Wall Street Journal.
Helen Dixon, who leads Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, said her office is on track to make draft decisions in roughly half a dozen privacy cases involving big technology companies this year, compared with just two last year.
“The pipeline is very strong. The momentum is building in terms of concluding these inquiries,” Ms. Dixon said in an interview.
Ms. Dixon is one of the world’s most influential privacy regulators because the data commission she leads is in charge enforcing the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, for companies that have their regional headquarters in Ireland.
Two cases involving Facebook are already on Ms. Dixon’s desk for draft decisions, she said. Five others, including one involving Google and others involving Facebook subsidiaries, are nearing the end of their investigations, with final reports either submitted to the companies for a final round of comments or received back, she added.

825,"February 24, 2021",Australia’s Regulator Is “Extremely Pleased” With Facebook Deal,"


Australia’s antitrust chief on Wednesday, February 24, claimed a victory over Facebook in a digital news battle that captivated the media world over the last week, reported CNBC.
Facebook blocked news pages a week ago Wednesday after the Australian government announced it was going to introduce a new law that would require Facebook to pay publishers for linking to their stories. The ban was short-lived, however, with Facebook cutting a deal with the Australian government on Monday that will see it restore news pages to its platform. Through that deal, some of the proposed legislation was amended and reportedly watered down.
Rod Sims, chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and architect of Australia’s media reforms, said in a statement that the commission is “extremely pleased” to see the amended legislation, dubbed the news media bargaining code, progressing through Australian Parliament this week.
“This is a significant step in maintaining a vibrant and diverse Australian news media sector which is essential for our society and democracy,” said Sims.
“The code will address a significant bargaining power imbalance between Australian news media businesses and major digital platforms,” he added. “With the code and its arbitration mechanism in place, the platforms have an incentive to offer fair payment for their use of news content, and Australian news businesses can negotiate commercial deals knowing a backup is in place should negotiations stall.”

826,"February 23, 2021",Facebook Reaches Deal With Australia To Restore News Sharing,"


Facebook will restore news pages in Australia after the government agreed to change a proposed law forcing tech companies to pay publishers for news content.
“Facebook has refriended Australia,” said Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg.
The proposal would force Google and Facebook to pay Australian news publishers for stories. It would allow media companies to bargain, either individually or collectively, with the companies over payment. If no agreement could be reached, payment terms would be set by a third-party arbitrator in a government-run process.
The government’s latest tweaks to the measure give the platforms more time to negotiate with publishers and clarify that they can potentially avoid forced arbitration if they reach deals.
Both platforms objected to the proposed media code, particularly its forced arbitration provision. But last week, Google dropped its objections and struck deals with the nation’s biggest publishers. Facebook, in contrast, protested and yanked news content from its site in Australia last Thursday, February 18, sparking outrage from critics around the world.
After a weekend of what Frydenberg described as “intensive negotiations,” Facebook backed down.
“We are satisfied that the Australian government has agreed to a number of changes and guarantees that address our core concerns about allowing commercial deals that recognize the value our platform provides to publishers relative to the value we receive from them,” said William Easton, Facebook’s managing director for Australia and New Zealand, in a statement. The platform contends that publishers benefit more than it does from having news on Facebook.

Facebook announced Thursday, February 18, it has blocked Australians from viewing and sharing news on the platform because of proposed laws in the country to make digital giants pay for journalism. Australian publishers can continue to publish news content on Facebook, but links and posts can’t be viewed or shared by Australian audiences, the US-based company said in a statement.
Australian users cannot share Australian or international news. International users outside Australia also cannot share Australian news.
“The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content,” Facebook regional managing director William Easton said.
“It has left us facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia. With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter,” Easton added.
The announcement came a day after Treasurer Josh Frydenberg described as “very promising” negotiations between Facebook and Google with Australian media companies. Frydenberg said after weekend talks with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiary Google, he was convinced that the platforms “do want to enter into these commercial arrangements. Frydenberg said he had had a “a constructive discussion” with Zuckerberg after Facebook blocked Australian news.
“He raised a few remaining issues with the Government’s news media bargaining code and we agreed to continue our conversation to try to find a pathway forward,” Frydenberg tweeted.

The Italian Antitrust authority announced on Wednesday, February 17, that it has fined Facebook €7 million for failing to follow its instructions to terminate the improper use of users’ data.
It also stated the social network had failed to comply with an order issued in November 2018 to publish a rectification statement regarding this issue on the homepage of the company’s website in Italy, on its app and on the personal page of each user registered in Italy.
It fined the US company €5 million (US$5.5 million) and asked it to publish an amended statement on the homepage of its website for Italy, on the Facebook app, and on the personal page of each registered Italian user.
“The current investigation has proved that …(the company has) not published the amended statement and has not stopped the established unfair practice,” the regulator said in its statement.
Given the economic value of the data for Facebook, it stated users should be put in a position to decide whether it should be used.
A Facebook spokesman said the company had taken notice of the regulator’s announcement but would “await the Council of State decision on our appeal against the Authority’s initial findings.”

Former Facebook, deputy general counsel S. Ashlie Beringer has rejoined Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in Palo Alto, California, as partner and co-chair of its privacy, cybersecurity and data innovation practice group, the firm announced Tuesday.
Beringer was most recently the vice president and deputy general counsel for Menlo Park, California-based Facebook, where she worked for almost seven years and oversaw the company’s litigation, regulatory, product and privacy issues during a time of both growth and turbulence. 
At Gibson Dunn, Beringer will advise tech companies on matters such as global regulations, data management, privacy, and security.

Apple became the fourth major digital company to face closer scrutiny from Germany’s antitrust watchdog on Monday, June 21, after the cartel office announced that it had launched an investigation into whether the tech giant is exploiting its market position, reported Reuters.
The Bonn-based watchdog stated that it will examine whether Apple has “paramount significance across markets” that thwarts competition.
“A key focus of the investigation will be the operation of the App Store, as in many cases it empowers Apple to influence the operations of third parties,” said Andreas Mundt, president of the Federal Cartel Office (FCO).
The watchdog has made use of enhanced powers gained under recent reforms to Germany’s competition laws to open investigations into Alphabet’s Google, Facebook, and Amazon over their data practices. 
Further proceedings against Apple are also being considered with regard to complaints received about potentially anti-competitive practices, the watchdog said.
These include a complaint that Apple gives itself preferential treatment by pre-installing its own applications, the watchdog stated.
An Apple spokesperson said the company’s App Store has given German developers of all sizes the same opportunity.
“We look forward to discussing our approach with the FCO and having an open dialogue about any of their concerns,” the spokesperson added.

831,"June 16, 2021","New Antitrust Bills Zero In Amazon, Apple, Facebook & Google","


Last week US lawmakers fired a shot across Big Tech’s bow, introducing five new bills designed to curb what lawmakers have described as “unregulated power” held by the firms of Silicon Valley. If enacted, the legislation would mark the biggest changes to US antitrust law in decades.
And while the legislation will affect all firms, their congressional architects have been open in naming the specific targets of the legislation.
“Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google have prioritized power over innovation and harmed American businesses and consumers in the process,” Rep. Ken Buck (R-Col.), the ranking member on the House antitrust subcommittee, said in a statement. “These companies have maintained monopoly power in the online marketplace by using a variety of anticompetitive behaviors to stifle competition.”
The new pieces of legislation would prohibit a dominant platform from discriminating against rivals by offering its own products preference (American Innovation and Choice Online Act); stop firms from using acquisitions as a means of neutralizing potential threats (Platform Competition and Opportunity Act); ban dominant platform from using their power across multiple types of business to give themselves unfair advantages (Ending Platform Monopolies Act); make it easier for consumers to move their data when they want to switch to a new provider (Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching Act); and change filing fees for the first time in two decades, providing the government funds to pursue antitrust actions.
Those bills are a long way and a lot of subcommittee hearings between now and becoming law — though regulation of Big Tech is one of the few areas where bipartisan action is still possible, as both Republicans and Democrats have qualms about the power Big Tech wields, and a determined interest in reining it in. And while the players most directly targeted by the new bills have not as yet offered any public comment, they will get their chance this week as they have been invited to appear before the House to testify.

Apple boss Tim Cook took aim on Wednesday at proposed European rules aimed at curbing the power of US tech giants, saying they could pose security and privacy risks to iPhones.
Cook, in his first public comments about the Digital Markets Act (DMA) proposed by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, said parts were good but others were not. He said he feared the draft rules would lead to more installing of apps that do not come via Apple’s App Store, or “side-loading”.
“You take an example here where I don’t think it’s in the best interest (of the user): the current DMA language that is being discussed would force side-loading on the iPhone,” the Apple CEO, speaking remotely, said at VivaTech, France´s biggest tech conference.
“And so this would be an ultimate way of getting apps onto the iPhone,” he said. “It would destroy the security of the iPhone, and a lot of the privacy initiatives that we’ve built into the App Store or the privacy intrusion labels and app-tracking transparency,” he added.
Earlier this month, EU lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who is leading the European Parliament scrutiny of the draft rules, said he wanted to beef up the legislation and narrow its scope to just big companies like Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook.

Britain’s competition regulator is investigating Apple and Google over allegations the two companies have a harmful duopoly in mobile platforms.
Between them, Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android are installed on 99.45% of all mobile phones in use in the UK. The two companies also have effective duopolies in app stores (Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store) and mobile web browsers (Apple’s Safari and Google’s Chrome), according to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).
The UK competition watchdog has announced a year-long study, already under way, into whether the control exerted by the two companies is stifling competition.
Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s chief executive, said, “Apple and Google control the major gateways through which people download apps or browse the web on their mobiles – whether they want to shop, play games, stream music or watch TV. We’re looking into whether this could be creating problems for consumers and the businesses that want to reach people through their phones.
“Our ongoing work into big tech has already uncovered some worrying trends and we know consumers and businesses could be harmed if they go unchecked.”
The CMA is looking at whether the duopoly is leading to price increases, for instance for devices and apps, or for broader goods and services, due to higher advertising prices. The regulator will also examine “any effects of the firms’ market power over other businesses – such as app developers – which rely on Apple or Google to market their products to customers via their phones.”

According to 9to5mac, the latest big tech antitrust hearing is being held by US lawmakers and Sonos is the main party testifying. Many of the company’s antitrust concerns revolve around Google and Amazon, but Sonos’ chief legal officer also called out its issues with Apple in his testimony.
Last month Tile, Spotify, and more testified to the US Congressional Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights in a hearing back in April. Apple and Google’s counsel also joined.
Tuesday, June 15’s hearing titled “Protecting Competition and Innovation in Home Technologies” includes Sonos sharing its concerns along with Amazon and Google presenting their cases. With Apple not being a central part of this hearing, it didn’t send a representative. However, that’s not to say Sonos didn’t share some concerns about how Apple handles its Siri and HomeKit business.
At the outset, Sonos chief legal officer Eddie Lazarus shared platform openness as key to its success vs. “a walled-garden experience.”
“Our success is based in significant part on elevating the idea of an open platform facilitating consumer choice rather than a walled-garden experience. Sonos customers can choose audio content to play on our systems from more than 100 streaming services, such as Spotify, Deezer, Tidal, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and Google’s YouTube Music. They can also choose between one of the two leading voice assistants, Amazon’s Alexa, and Google Assistant. Moreover, we provide these services with a strong emphasis on quality and privacy, focusing on using customer data to enhance their experience rather than aggressive monetization.”

The Japanese government is said to be preparing another antitrust probe into both tech giants Apple and Google, the media reported. Apple has been the subject of multiple antitrust probes alongside other tech giants, including Google.
It seems that Japan will be adding its own investigation to the pile soon, one that will affect both the iPhone maker and the search giant.
A government panel will apparently launch this month to look into tightening antitrust regulations, according to sources of Nikkei in a report seen by the Mercury News.
The panel will discuss the dealings of Apple and Google with Japanese smartphone producers, including whether they handle domestic companies fairly compared to overseas vendors.
It is believed that iOS and Android make up more than 90 per cent of the Japanese smartphone market, according to the report.
An analysis by IDC in February pointed to Apple selling nearly half of all mobile phones in the country for the entirety of 2020.
The alleged Japanese probe will become the latest in a long line of similar activity by governments and regulators around the world, seeking to curtail the power of tech giants like Apple.

836,"June 10, 2021",EU Vestager Wants Apple To Allow Alternate App Stores,"


The chief of the European antitrust commission, Margrethe Vestager, wants Apple to allow alternate app stores to enable proper competition on its platforms, reported Apple Insider.
The Epic versus Apple trial was not the end of scrutiny against Apple’s business practices on the iPhone. Vestager hopes to push Apple and other tech companies to open up with new regulations.
In an interview with Kara Swisher on the “Sway” podcast, Vestager spoke about her battles against big tech and what is coming next. Most prominently, she wants legislation that will force “gatekeepers” to allow more competition on the platforms they have created, one being Apple.
“What we have tabled now as proposed legislation is to say, well, if you buy these objective criteria, qualitative and quantitative, will be designated as a gatekeeper, then from the very first day these are the things that you cannot do,” Vestager said while describing the Digital Markets Act. “These are the things that you have to do. Have to do could be make room for a second app store. Have to do could be share data.”
Vestager believes a lot of Epic’s complaints could be solved by allowing a second App Store. Apps on Apple’s platform have to be in the Apple-controlled store, use Apple-controlled payments, and engage with customers following Apple-controlled rules.
Swisher noted that Apple’s arguments for the single App Store and maintaining control of it, are to maintain privacy and security. Specifically, Swisher proposed that since Apple created the market, it should be able to control it.

837,"June 7, 2021",Apple’s App Store Faces Renewed Criticism,"


Apple’s App Store faces renewed criticism as the company hosts its annual conference for app developers. Due to the pandemic, the event is being held online for the second year.
In the conference that started Monday, June 7, Apple CEO Tim Cook and company executives are addressing a key audience at a time the iPhone maker has been defending itself in court over its App Store practices. The Apple Worldwide Developers Conference typically attracts thousands of app developers.
Reuters reported that Apple has been under fire from various quarters, including prominent developer and technology podcast host Marco Arment. 
In a blog post last week, on June 3, Arment wrote that Apple’s leaders need to acknowledge “two obvious truths” regarding developers. For one, he stated, “our apps provide substantial value to iOS beyond the purchase commissions collected by Apple. In addition, he wrote, some customers come “to our apps from our own marketing or reputation, rather than the App Store.”
He added, “Without our apps, the iPhone has little value to most of its customers today.”
Apple’s App Store and services have been in the spotlight of late as the company has faced a recently concluded antitrust lawsuit brought by Fortnite creator Epic Games. A federal judge will rule on the case.

838,"June 6, 2021","Privacy by Default, Abuse by Design: EU Competition Concerns About Apple’s New App Tracking Policy","


By Thomas Hoppner (Technical University Wildau) & Philipp Westerhoff (Hausfeld)
With the most recent updates of its mobile operating systems, in April 2021 Apple implemented a new global App Tracking Transparency policy. The policy obliges app developers to display an additional (Apple-designed) prompt to request permission from end users for the developer to “track” the user, even when the user has already consented to the sharing of its data through the developer’s own consent tool. Apple presents the new policy as a step to enhance privacy. Others, including the authors of this article, see it as a “bombshell for third-party mobile ad tech” that, together with Google’s disabling of third-party cookies, only entrenches the data supremacy of Apple and Google, and forecloses data-based competition and consumer choice across the entire Apple ecosystem.

839,"June 2, 2021",The Monopolist Worm in Apple,"


By Horacio Gutierrez, Wall Street Journal
There is a lot to admire about Apple, but my company, Spotify, has seen another, brutish side. Apple designs, develops and sells some of the world’s most desirable hardware products. And for many, Steve Jobs remains a figure of reverence, giving the business he created an enduring glow. My business is one of the few insisting that underneath that exterior is a ruthless bully that uses its dominance to hobble competitors. But over the past couple of years regulators around the world have finally begun examining Apple’s conduct. Many don’t like what they’re seeing.
Last month the European Commission announced its Statement of Objections, an important formal step in antitrust investigations, in response to a complaint Spotify filed two years ago about Apple’s behavior. The commission is concerned about two aspects of the company’s app-store policies. First, Apple forces app developers to use its payment system and to hand over 30% of all new subscription fees for the privilege.

840,"November 16, 2016",EU: Microsoft offers ‘concessions’ to  antitrust regulators over $26.2bn LinkedIn deal,"
Microsoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26 billion bid for social network LinkedIn, the European Commission said on Wednesday, as the US software company seeks to allay concerns over its largest ever deal.
The move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week.
The Commission, which will rule on the deal by Dec. 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation.
The LinkedIn acquisition will allow Microsoft to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing.
LinkedIn makes most of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.

In their review of Microsoft Corp.’s $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., European Union antitrust regulators are attempting to measure the rough value of the professional network’s data and whether rival sites can replicate it, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The European Commission, the bloc’s antitrust authority, has sent out questionnaires to competitors as part of its standard merger review process after the companies formally registered the deal with the EU last week, people familiar with the matter said.
The commission has previously said it would scrutinize mergers involving large amounts of data more closely, and may start reviewing deals involving smaller companies, especially in cases when a firm snaps up another just to get hold of its data.

Microsoft on Friday said it is seeking regulatory approval of its LinkedIn acquisition from the European Union.
“We can confirm we have notified the Microsoft LinkedIn deal to the European Commission,” a Microsoft spokesperson said.
Reuters first reported on news of the filing, writing that the commission has set a Nov. 22 deadline to review the case. Should the commission have any concerns, they can open an investigation on the matter.
The company stressed to regulators that the deal could unfairly exclude other companies from accessing LinkedIn’s vast amount of data and that Microsoft could gain an unfair advantage by combining its software with this data.
European Commissioner on Competition Margarethe Vestager has previously said that data is something the commission will look at in assessing antitrust cases.
“A company might even buy up a rival just to get hold of its data, even though it hasn’t yet managed to turn that data into money,” she said.
“We are therefore exploring whether we need to start looking at mergers with valuable data involved, even though the company that owns it doesn’t have a large turnover.”

844,"October 4, 2016","EU: US giants at it in Brussels, Salesforce against Microsoft over Linkedin deal","
When earlier this year Microsoft snapped up the world’s headlines by announcing it would have acquired LinkedIn with a colossal $26.2 billion deal, everyone was already preparing for the shockwaves this move would have generated.
Last week, US cloud computing company Salesforce.com openly urged European Union regulators to block the acquisition over unfair competition concerns. The breaking news made clear that antitrust will be once more a huge weapon for competition, and that the match will be once again played on the EU field.
US giant Microsoft Corp. announced three months ago a deal to buy the world’s largest professional networking platform LinkedIn, with an all-cash deal worth a total of $26.2 billion, $196 a share. The deal represents the company’s largest purchase and one of the biggest technology acquisitions ever in history. Microsoft indeed has been chasing the acquisition desperately, in a strong attempt to revitalize its activity after some tough years behind competitors. Chief Executive Satya Nadella openly declared he was hoping the deal will open new horizons for Microsoft’s Office suite to escape a saturated market.
The entire Redmond, Washington-based company had hoped indeed to get EU approval quickly and to be able to close the deal in the next few weeks, however the situation looks now a bit more complex. Last Thursday, the Californian Salesforce.com openly said the deal threatens innovation and competition, and formally urged the European Union, regular punisher of Microsoft, to take a close look at Microsoft’s takeover of LinkedIn through an official statement.

845,"October 2, 2016",EU: Salesforce challenges Microsoft’s data acquisition,"
The European Commission has mentioned that it may start requiring all data-rich merger to seek approval rather than continuing with current guidelines which require approval only for mergers where the annual turnover of the combined businesses exceeds specified thresholds.
One current deal that seems to be spurring these considerations is the acquisition of the online careers site LinkedIn by Microsoft.
Salesforce, a leading opponent of the deal, is also suggesting to regulators that Microsoft will create proprietary bundles of its services and LinkedIn data.
Data in all forms seems valuable right now, because rich and varied data is at the core of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the basis for analyzing and predicting almost any action that can be digitally measured.
Essentially, the people are proposing judging anti-competitiveness on the basis of something with imputed value, the uses of which aren’t fully understood yet.

Now, Salesforce has raised competitin questions in Europe focused on whether Microsoft’s proposed deal would hinder access by people and companies to the vast collection of data held by LinkedIn. Salesforce.com has also suggested that the deal would give Microsoft an unfair advantage over rivals by combining its own software services with the information held by the social network.
Salesforce.com’s concerns do not necessarily mean that Commissioner Margrethe Vestager will open an investigation into Microsoft’s purchase of LinkedIn, though on Thursday she raised her own questions about how digital data should be treated in future competition cases.

“Any moves to force clients to purchase products with bundled packages are against antitrust law,” the source said.

Any probe into Microsoft’s acquisition of professional social network LinkedIn Corp. is likely to focus on the tie-up’s potential to leverage vast amounts of user data, the European Union’s antitrust chief said Friday.
The European Commission would look at whether “the data purchased in the deal has a very long durability and might constitute a barrier for others, or if they can be replicated so that others stand a chance to enter the market,” Margrethe Vestager said.
“We’ve done that kind of analysis in the past and it’s something we’re generally paying a lot of attention to,” she said in an interview in Copenhagen Friday.
The Dane, who took office at the end of 2014, has signaled a willingness to delve more into how merging companies leverage the treasure trove of data at their disposal. Data was one of the key considerations in the review of Facebook’s takeover of messaging service WhatsApp, even though her predecessor in the end concluded there were no data-usage concerns.
Vestager warned earlier this year that even though the regulator hasn’t found a data competition problem yet, “this doesn’t mean we never will.”

849,"June 13, 2016",US: Microsoft to buy LinkedIn in deal valued at $26.2 billion,"
Microsoft has bought LinkedIn for $26.2 billion, as the Seattle-based software company seeks to expand its reach into professional networking.
The deal is Microsoft’s biggest-ever acquisition, and follows a pattern of bold moves by chief executive Satya Nadella to reinvent the company that is known primarily as the maker of Windows.
The purchase of LinkedIn will allow Microsoft to link the professional network with its intelligent digital assistant, Cortana, and its customer relationship management software.
LinkedIn, which has a growing network of more than 100m monthly active users, had seen its share price fall 40 per cent this year before the deal was announced. Analysts have expressed concern that the company’s growth would slow and that the subscription service it sells to recruiters was vulnerable to a global economic slowdown.
Both companies are facing increased competition in the professional software market, as companies try to change the way people communicate in the office. Popular work chat app Slack and Facebook’s professional subscription service Facebook at Work have led some analysts to predict that professional use of the internet will be shaped by social networks in the same way that the consumer internet has been.

Italy’s antitrust regulator has fined Google and iPhone maker Apple 10 million euros ($11.2 million) each for “aggressive practices” linked to the commercial use of user data, reported Reuters. 
The authority said in a statement the two tech groups did not provide “clear and immediate information” on how they collect and use the data of those who access their services.
Both Google and Apple said they disagreed with the antitrust decision and that they would appeal it.
The watchdog said that when users set up their account with Google, the system was designed in such a way that the terms and conditions on data usage were set up to be accepted.
In the case of Apple, users do not have a choice on the issue, the antitrust regulator added.
“We provide industry-leading transparency and control to all users, so they can choose what information to share or not, and how it’s used,” Apple said in a statement, describing the regulator’s view as “wrong”.
Google said in a statement it followed “fair and transparent practices to provide users with useful services, as well as provide clear information on their use”.

852,"November 28, 2021",Google Revises Privacy Sandbox Proposals For UK Watchdog,"
The UK competition watchdog said that it has secured improved commitments from Google on proposals to remove third-party cookies and other functions from its Chrome browser.
The Competition and Markets Authority said Google’s revised privacy proposals address its competition concerns, and the regulator is now consulting on these modifications.
In 2019, Google launched the Privacy Sandbox initiative. It includes proposals to improve online security and address covert tracking techniques. The company says tracking technologies need to be addressed in order to protect privacy online.
However, the CMA has been investigating Google’s Privacy Sandbox proposals since the start of the year due to concerns that they could impede competition in digital advertising markets, causing advertising spending to become even more concentrated on Google.
Now, Google has offered to appoint an independent monitoring trustee, more extensive testing commitments and a more transparent process to take market feedback on the Privacy Sandbox proposals. It has also committed not to use Google first-party personal data to track users for targeting and measurement of ads shown on non-Google websites.
“If accepted, the commitments we have obtained from Google become legally binding, promoting competition in digital markets, helping to protect the ability of online publishers to raise money through advertising and safeguarding users’ privacy,” CMA Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said.

Support for curbing large technology companies’ market power is widening in the Senate, with lawmakers in both parties endorsing new legal constraints on search engines, e-marketplaces, app stores and other online platforms.

The measures must overcome a stepped-up lobbying effort in opposition from companies including Google,Amazon and Apple which say many of the proposals will hurt consumers who have grown dependent on their products and services.

Alphabet-unit Google contested the claims using the EU’s second-highest court.

Amazon has announced new partnerships in hopes of enhancing its connected devices to compete with products such as Apple AirTags.
The company said Friday it had formed partnerships with Tile, which makes trackers for lost items, and the smart lock maker Level in hopes of using this technology to enhance network tracking based on WiFi and Bluetooth.
“The strength and number of devices on a given tracking network is key to its accuracy,” writes CNBC in the network’s report on the announcement. “That’s part of the reason why many think Apple’s tracking network will be so strong since it relies on more than 1 billion iPhones, iPads and Macs to help with lost item tracking.”
As CNBC noted, Tile has spoken out against Apple’s ventures into lost-item tracking, testifying before Congress that they and other app developers fear Apple’s policies governing third-party apps and hardware accessories.
Last year, Tile accused Apple of tweaking its operating systems by changing default settings and turning off the “always allow” default — which disables third-party tracking tools — while setting its own FindMY app to default to “on.” Apple has denied these allegations.
Apple announced the AirTags last month, its own Tile-like product, as part of its annual Spring Loaded device showcase.
As CNBC notes, “they work in a similar way with iOS devices like iPhones and iPads. Now Tile will connect through a larger technology ecosystem, pitting Amazon and Apple against each other in a new front of connected devices.”
Amazon says the new partnerships will let it upgrade its Sidewalk tracking network by allowing Tile and Level devices to connect to Amazon Echo products. Tile will begin working with Amazon devices next month, integrating compatible Echo devices to extend Tile’s network to help users recover lost keys or other items.

Two Republican lawmakers are pressing the Justice Department and the Pentagon to reopen a probe into conflicts of interest between Amazon ex-employees and consultants and the government architects of a Department of Defense’s (DOD) US$10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud computing program.
Sen. Mike Lee (Republican – Utah) and Rep. Ken Buck (Republican – Colorado), leaders on antitrust subcommittees in their respective chambers, sent letters on May 4 to Attorney General Merrick Garland and acting Defense Department Inspector General Sean O’Donnell as well as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos asking for information, documents and, in the case of the Justice Department, a probe into possible anticompetitive behavior on the part of Amazon Web Services.
“We are concerned that Amazon may have attempted to monopolize one or more markets relating to government and/or commercial cloud computing services by improperly influencing the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure procurement process,” Senators Lee and Buck wrote.
The letters were released on May the Fourth because of the date’s memetic association with the Star Wars saga, Lee indicated in a hashtag of a tweet promoting a Wall Street Journal article on the allegations.
The letter to Garland and the letters to Bezos and O’Connell detail allegations of interference by former defense officials with ties to Amazon that were the subject of a DOD OIG investigation and circulated in press reports after the JEDI request for proposals was released and before the eventual award to Microsoft in Oct. 2019.

864,"April 14, 2021",Indian Merchants Fight Back Against Amazon With Protest Event ,"


Small businesses in India are fighting back against Amazon and other big foreign sellers in a move to actively protest what they see as an unfair competitive advantage for US technology platforms, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, April 14.
Scores of smaller businesses are setting the stage for a protest event on Thursday, April 15, which coincides with Amazon’s yearly jamboree for its sellers in India. Retailers in the country are escalating the fight for a piece of India’s potential market of 1.3 billion shoppers. The group is also protesting against Walmart’s Flipkart.
“Over half a million sellers and leading small trader groups are participating in the Asmbhav event, which will focus on ruined livelihoods because of the bullying and partisanship by eCommerce marketplaces,” Abhay Raj Mishra, head of the nonprofit Public Response Against Helplessness and Action for Redressal (PRAHAR), told Bloomberg.
Asmbhav — which means “impossible” in Hindi — is just one of the many protests being led by a collective of Indian sellers to tackle the “unfair practices” brought about by foreign eCommerce businesses, per the article. 
Local traders in India have not been shy about pointing to Amazon and Flipkart as being detrimental to a competitive selling landscape in the country. Merchants have long accused both eCommerce powerhouses of stifling competition and the associated livelihoods of the businesses and people who work and live in the country.
The government’s move would also enforce existing rules that prohibit eCommerce platforms from “owning or controlling” companies that sell on their websites, from making exclusive deals with manufacturers of products, and from offering discounts on goods.

865,"April 6, 2021",Coalition Of Small Businesses Want Stricter Antitrust Laws For Amazon,"
A national coalition will campaign for stricter antitrust laws, including measures that could force Amazon to spin off some of its business, reported Wall Street Journal.
The effort is being launched Tuesday, April 6, by trade groups that represent small hardware stores, office suppliers, booksellers, grocers and others, along with business groups from 12 cities, organizers say. Merchants plan to push their congressional representatives for stricter antitrust laws and tougher enforcement of existing ones.
The groups, which collectively represent thousands of businesses, want federal legislation that would prevent the owner of a dominant online marketplace from selling its own products in competition with other sellers, a policy that could effectively separate Amazon’s retail product business from its online marketplace.
Members of the House Antitrust Subcommittee are considering legislation along those lines as they weigh changes to US antitrust law, though no bill has yet been introduced.
The merchant groups also want tougher enforcement of competition laws and legal changes that would make it easier for the government to win antitrust lawsuits against big companies. 
In a statement, an Amazon spokesperson said the company’s critics “are suggesting misguided interventions in the free market that would kill off independent retailers and punish consumers by forcing small businesses out of popular online stores, raising prices, and reducing consumer choice and convenience.”
“Amazon and third-party sellers complement each other, and sellers having the opportunity to sell right alongside a retailer’s products is the very competition that most benefits consumers and has made the marketplace model so successful for third-party sellers,” the spokesperson added.

866,"April 4, 2021",Amazon Prepares Its Defense Against Antitrust Scrutiny,"


Amazon is gearing up to defend itself against a mushrooming battle over the company’s alleged anticompetitive business practices, in arenas spanning Congress, federal agencies, and state government, reported the Seattle Times.
The commerce giant is expanding its legal team, hiring former federal prosecutors and regulators to fill roles that include defending the company against allegations that it unfairly dominates markets. The company has tweaked its public messaging to downplay its role as the world’s largest online retailer. It has also tried to boost its image in Washington, DC, spending more on federal lobbying in 2020 than ever before. 
Together, those moves can be read as Amazon erecting a shield against stepped-up antitrust scrutiny, said University of Washington tech historian Margaret O’Mara. 
Amazon is “deploying their considerable resources and readying for what’s clearly a very different relationship with Washington (D.C.) than tech has usually enjoyed,” O’Mara said.  
Amazon has objected to criticisms that it has grown too large. The company operates “a diverse range of businesses” in an “extraordinarily competitive” global retail marketplace, company spokesperson Dan Perlet said in a statement.

867,"March 28, 2021",Booksellers Sue Amazon & Big Five Publishers For Price-Fixing,"


Amazon and the “Big Five” publishers – Penguin Random House, Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, and Simon & Schuster – have been accused of colluding to fix ebook prices, in a class action filed by the law firm that successfully sued Apple and the Big Five on the same charge 10 years ago.
The lawsuit, filed in district court in New York on Thursday, March 25, by Seattle firm Hagens Berman, on behalf of consumers in several US states, names the retail giant as the sole defendant but labels the publishers “co-conspirators.” It alleges Amazon and the publishers use a clause known as “Most Favored Nations” (MFN) to keep ebook prices artificially high, by agreeing to price restraints that force consumers to pay more for ebooks purchased on retail platforms that are not Amazon.com.
The lawsuit claims that almost 90% of all ebooks sold in the US are sold on Amazon, in addition to over 50% of all print books. The suit alleges that ebook prices dropped in 2013 and 2014 after Apple and major publishers were successfully sued for conspiring to set ebook prices, but rose again after Amazon renegotiated their contracts in 2015.
“In violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, Defendant and the Big Five Co-conspirators agreed to various anti-competitive MFNs and anti-competitive provisions that functioned the same as MFNs,” the complaint states. “Amazon’s agreement with its Co-conspirators is an unreasonable restraint of trade that prevents competitive pricing and causes Plaintiffs and other consumers to overpay when they purchase ebooks from the Big Five through an ebook retailer that competes with Amazon. That harm persists and will not abate unless Amazon and the Big Five are stopped.”

868,"March 25, 2021", Amazon Asks India To Delay New eCommerce Rules,"


As India’s digital commerce battle heats up, the government is investigating Amazon’s business practices and is eyeing new regulations for eCommerce companies. India’s regulators are focusing on two issues: the treatment of sellers on the big eCommerce sites and foreign investment in those sites.
Now, Amazon is asking that India hold off on making any changes to its eCommerce foreign investment rules until after the probes are completed, Reuters reported on Thursday, March 25, citing sources.
In a meeting on Thursday, an Amazon executive told commerce ministry officials that the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and the Enforcement Directorate are investigating the company. The executive said that “it would be premature to make any policy change” until those probes are finished, two sources told Reuters.
Indian retailers are arguing that the actions of Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart hurt small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and bypass India’s rules on foreign investment. The two retail giants counter that they are in fact helping India’s small businesses.
India’s government has been considering changing policies amid allegations from SMBs that Amazon and Flipkart show some sellers preferential treatment, which both eCommerce operations deny. However, a Reuters “special report” based on internal documents claimed that Amazon at least had been engaging in such practices. In the report, Reuters stated that “Amazon favored big sellers on its India platform — and used them to maneuver around rules meant to protect the country’s small retailers from getting crushed by eCommerce giants, internal documents show.”
According to a draft of regulations India is considering, “eCommerce operators must ensure equal treatment of all sellers/vendors registered on their platforms and not adopt algorithms that result in prioritizing select vendors/sellers.” The draft regulations also stated, according to Reuters, that eCommerce companies must “bring out clear and transparent policies” insofar as online discounts are concerned.

869,"March 25, 2021",Facebook & Amazon Top Lobbying Spenders In The US,"


Facebook and Amazon have become the US’s two biggest corporate lobbying spenders, investing almost twice as much as oil giant ExxonMobil and tobacco company Philip Morris in 2020, according to a new report.
Amazon increased its spending on lobbying efforts by 30% during the period from 2018 to 2020 to reach US$18.7 million, according to a report published by Public Citizen, a progressive consumer rights advocacy group, and based on data by the Center for Responsive Politics. Facebook spent 56% more in the same period to reach around US$19.6 million, the report found.
ExxonMobil spent US$8.69 million on lobbying efforts in 2020, according to its public Lobbying Disclosure Act filings. While Philip Morris spent US$6.95 million in lobbying in 2020 according to data published by the Center for Responsive Politics.
The Public Citizen report evaluated the influence of the four tech giants—Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple— on regulators and lawmakers through lobbying and contributions.
“The foundation of the Big Tech companies’ influence are their lobbying teams, which use campaign contributions, existing relationships, and past experience to swing policy in their favor,” Public Citizen stated in the report.

870,"January 31, 2021",Google & Facebook Face New Antitrust Suit From Virginia News Publisher,"


A Virginia news publisher has filed an antitrust suit against Google and Facebook, who together receive roughly half of all digital ad dollars in the US and are facing antitrust charges from federal and state authorities, reported The New York Times.
The company, HD Media, owns several papers in the state, including the Herald-Dispatch in Huntington and the Charleston Gazette-Mail.
HD Media claims Google has so monopolized the online ad market that “it threatens the extinction of local newspapers across the country.” The suit also alleges that Google and Facebook conspired to further their dominance with a secret agreement, referring to a suit filed by 10 Republican attorneys general in December.
The company does not specify the impact on its business of the behavior of Facebook and Google beyond saying that it has hurt its ability to “effectively monetize its content” because Google is enabled to take an uncompetitive share of the news publisher’s ad revenues. A lawyer for the company declined to speak on the record.
It’s the first antitrust lawsuit against a tech platform focused on news publishing, said David Chavern, head of the news trade group News Media Alliance. He said the group was not involved in the suit.
HD Media filed in federal court in West Virginia and asked for a jury trial. It asked for unspecified damages and that the court stop Google and Facebook from the uncompetitive conduct it is alleging.

871,"January 29, 2021",Facebook and Twitter Made the Right Decision. Big Tech Is Still Too Powerful.,"
By: Charlotte Slaiman (Public Knowledge)
What a week. On Tuesday, if you stayed up late enough (or woke at 3 a.m. Wednesday morning to a screaming baby, as I did) we saw Democrats win control of the Senate via a special election in Georgia. On Wednesday, we witnessed an armed insurrection on the Capitol Building, directed by President Trump in part through social media platforms, causing five deaths. On Thursday, we had a second to breathe, and then on Friday night, Twitter and Facebook suspended Donald Trump’s accounts (Facebook for only two weeks, Twitter permanently). We could not look away last week as the real-world impact of social media became glaringly clear. Our proposal for a digital platform regulator is an important tool for addressing the power of digital platforms and has become even more important after last week.
The growing debate on the platforms’ choice to ban President Trump, given all the context leading up to this action, has seen folks arguing a few different ideas: 1) Facebook and Twitter see that Democrats will now have much more power in government, and so are suddenly trying to do the right thing to avoid regulation and other government intervention; 2) Donald Trump was using Twitter to incite an armed mob to attack the U.S. Capitol, putting lives and the peaceful transfer of power at risk, so it’s obvious that his accounts should be shut down; and 3) The fact that having a Facebook or Twitter account shut down or kept up has such an impact on our politics shows the power that these platforms have and what a problem that is.
Lastly, folks are wondering what we even want in this situation. Do we want a system where private companies can make such important decisions regarding speech? Or do we want a system where messages that incite such incredibly destructive acts are able to appear on mainstream, dominant platforms? I’d argue we don’t have to choose between these two bad options…

UK’s competition watchdog on Thursday, January 28, launched its initial investigation into Facebook’s completed acquisition of GIF website Giphy, reported Reuters.
The world’s largest social media company bought Giphy, a website for making and sharing animated images, or GIFs, in May last year to integrate it with its rapidly growing photo-sharing app, Instagram.
However, a source told Reuters in June that Facebook was pausing the integration of Giphy into Instagram after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) served an initial enforcement order.
Governments around the world are looking at strengthening the regulation of tech firms that have become even more powerful during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the CMA announcing last month that tailored rules should be used to regulate them.
“We will continue to fully cooperate with the CMA’s investigation. This merger is procompetitive and in the interests of everyone in the UK who uses GIPHY and our services,” a Facebook spokesperson said on Thursday.
The CMA stated it has until March 25 to decide whether it should make a reference for an in-depth investigation.

873,"January 28, 2021",Facebook May Be Preparing Antitrust Suit Against Apple,"


Facebook is preparing to launch a lawsuit against Apple for alleged anti-competitive behavior, particularly regarding App Tracking Transparency and iMessage, according to The Information.
The antitrust lawsuit would contend that Apple has abused its power in the smartphone industry by enforcing App Store rules that Apple itself supposedly does not have to follow. Within this, the case would argue rules such as the requirement that developers use Apple’s own in-app payment service, make it harder to compete in areas such as gaming, messaging, and shopping.
iOS 14’s App Tracking Transparency feature, which allows users to opt-out of being tracked via an on-screen prompt, is believed to be central to Facebook’s case. Facebook alleges that the prompts are unfair because they do not appear for Apple’s own apps, offering it a competitive advantage. However, Apple’s apps do not track users or share data for advertising purposes, so this seems to be a bemusing foundation for the lawsuit.
In addition to App Tracking Transparency, Facebook is expected to focus on Apple’s refusal to allow third-party messaging apps to be installed as the default option on iPhones and iPads. The company lobbied Apple to allow users to choose Facebook’s Messenger app as the default on iOS instead of iMessage in September last year, and it now claims that Apple disallows other messaging apps to be set as default in an effort to prevent people from switching to competing smartphone brands.

874,"January 28, 2021",Germany Deepens Facebook & Oculus Probe,"


Germany’s antitrust regulator announced on Thursday, January 28, that it was extending the scope of its abuse proceedings against Facebook related to the links between its Oculus virtual reality products and the social media network, reported Reuters.
The move comes after legislation took effect earlier this month that sets new rules for “undertakings of paramount significance for competition across markets,” the Federal Cartel Office said in a statement.
“An ecosystem which extends across various markets – an almost unchallengeable position of economic power – is particularly characteristic in this respect,” cartel office chief Andreas Mundt said in a statement.
“In view of Facebook’s strong market presence with the eponymous social network, WhatsApp and Instagram such a position may be deemed to exist. This is the first case in which we are putting the new provisions to use,” he added.
Although antitrust oversight in the European Union lies chiefly in the purview of its Brussels-based executive, Mundt has taken an activist approach towards Facebook and what he considers as abuse of its market dominance.
Mundt issued an order in February 2019 to curb Facebook’s collection of data from users, triggering a prolonged court battle that continues.

The US Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust lawsuit against Facebook was transferred to another judge on Tuesday so that it and a similar case filed by state attorneys general will be heard by the same person, according to Reuters.
Both the FTC and a large group of state attorneys general, led by New York, filed lawsuits against Facebookin December before the US District Court for the District of Columbia alleging violations of antitrust law.
The state attorneys general requested last month that the cases be consolidated. Facebook objected to the consolidation, saying it was “premature and unnecessary” but did not object to the same judge hearing both cases.
Judge Chris Cooper, who had been assigned the FTC’s case, said in a minute order on Tuesday that he was asking for it to be re-assigned to Judge James Boasberg, who is hearing the similar case filed by state attorneys general.
Boasberg was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama, and is also presiding judge on the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which considers surveillance requests from U.S. law enforcement.

Australia’s competition regulator has warned that planned laws to make the country the first in the world to force Google and Facebook to pay for news content were likely just the start of more regulation for digital platforms, reported Reuters.
The Australian government announced legislation last month after an investigation it said showed the tech giants held too much market power in the media industry, a situation it said posed a potential threat to a well-functioning democracy.
Under the code, Google and Facebook will be subject to mandatory price arbitration if a commercial agreement on payment for Australian media cannot be reached.
“This bargaining code is a journey, if we see market power elsewhere, we can add them to the code,” Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman (ACCC) Rod Sims said in an interview for Reuters Next.
Digital platforms face fines of up to A$10 million ($7.7 million) if they do not comply with the decision.

877,"January 11, 2021","Turkish Watchdog Probes WhatsApp, Facebook Over Privacy Policy","


Turkey’s competition regulator has launched an investigation against WhatsApp and Facebook due to their new privacy policy, Anadolu news agency reported on Monday, January 11.
Developers of the WhatsApp messenger app have updated their user agreement, adding a provision on personal data transfer to Facebook.
The updated agreement states that WhatsApp, being part of the Facebook corporation, will share necessary information about users to analyze their habits and tastes. In response, Turkish users, including high-ranking officials, are actively switching to alternative messengers.
The competition regulator has also suspended the new WhatsApp user agreement.
Ali Taha Koc, head of the Turkish Presidential Digital Transformation Office, on Saturday criticized the new terms of services as well as the announced exemption from the new data-sharing rules for UK and EU users.
“The distinction between EU member countries and others in terms of data privacy is unacceptable! As we have cited in the Information and Communication Security Guideline, foreign origin applications bear significant risks regarding data security,” he wrote in a tweet.

878,"January 5, 2021",Court Asked To Delay Consolidating Facebook Cases,"


According to a Bloomberg report, Facebook is asking a District of Columbia federal court to delay deciding whether it will consolidate two antitrust lawsuits until they have had time to answer the complaints.
Facebook, targeted last month in separate suits brought by the Federal Trade Commission and by 48 attorneys general, says consolidation should wait because certain claims and parties “may take different paths,” according to a memorandum filed Monday in the US District Court for the District of Columbia.
In December the FTC and 46 states sued Facebook, accusing the social-media giant of buying and freezing out small startups to choke competition.
The FTC’s sweeping antitrust case seeks to force Facebook to unwind its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, two of its landmark deals. The states filed a separate and similar lawsuit, alleging a lack of competition has harmed consumers, including by weakening privacy protections.

879,"January 3, 2021",Facebook May License Code To Competitors To Ease Antitrust Concerns,"


Facebook has put forward the idea of easing antitrust concerns by allowing a competitor to license access to its code and its users’ collection of relationships to allow for the easier development of a rival social platform, according to unnamed sources in a report from The Washington Post.
The social media company didn’t provide the Post with company executives to talk about the matter, but company representative Chris Sgro told the outlet that “we will continue to vigorously defend the ability of people and businesses to choose our free services, advertising, and apps because of the value they bring.”
Facebook provided the offer to state and federal investigators who were preparing two antitrust suits against it, according to the report, which noted that investors ended up turning down the idea.
Facebook and Google are encountering many antitrust lawsuits in addition to probes by European and American regulators. For example, Facebook faces an antitrust suit backed by the US Federal Trade Commission and 46 states, while Google has been hit by an antitrust suit filed by a group of 38 state attorneys general.

The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) lobby group on Wednesday, June 2, backed the European Union’s antitrust case against Apple which alleges it distorts competition in the music streaming market, reported Reuters.
The European Commission filed its first antitrust charges against Apple in April following an initial complaint by the iPhone maker’s rival Spotify.
Apple has rejected the EU charges, claiming that its App Store enabled Spotify to become the world’s largest music subscription service. It has been given 12 weeks to respond to the charges.
BEUC stated it has been allowed to join as an interested third party in the antitrust regulator’s case, which could lead to a hefty fine of as much as 10% of Apple’s global turnover and force a change to its business practices.

881,"June 1, 2021",Spotify Exec Agrees With Antitrust Pressure On Apple,"


Spotify executive Horacio Gutierrez has explained in a wide-reaching interview with The Verge why the company believes Apple is a “ruthless bully” and what it would like to see change.
Last month, Gutierrez penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that chastised Apple and some of its business practices. Now, Spotify’s head of global affairs and chief legal officer has expanded on the logic behind the company’s antitrust dispute with Apple.
Gutierrez’s main justification underpinning the argument that Apple’s App Store payment system is not a necessary part of its business is that it “wasn’t part of the ‌App Store‌ in the beginning.”
“Concretely, when it comes to the ‌AppStore‌, it is very clear that the choice to tie Apple’s proprietary payment system to the ‌AppStore‌ was an arbitrary choice. It wasn’t part of the ‌App Store‌ in the beginning, just as the 30 percent Apple tax wasn’t a requirement when we made it into the ‌App Store‌. They bolted that on later in the process and in doing that, they created this environment in which competing apps really have to contend with Apple’s own music streaming service as well as other competing products on what’s not really a level playing field.”
Apple’s 30%t commission on ‌App Store‌ sales and in-app purchases was also raised as an “arbitrary rate,” and Gutierrez explained that it is not merely a reduction in commission that Spotify is looking to achieve.
“The issue is not whether the rate is 30 or 15 or 10 percent, the issue is that the rate is arbitrary and they get to set it unilaterally because they’ve insulated themselves from competition. What should happen is Apple should be able to charge 30, or 50 percent, if they can convince users in a market economy that the value that they provide justifies the 30 percent, or the 15 percent, or the 50 percent. What we’re saying is they actually prevent competitors from coming in and offering alternative payment systems, and therefore there is no market.”
Gutierrez explained that Spotify would like to see Apple return to its previous approach with the ‌App Store‌ and loosen its grip on rules and penalties.

"
882,"May 27, 2021",Harming Competition and Consumers Under the Guise of Protecting Privacy: An Analysis of Apple’s iOS 14 Policy Updates,"

By D. Daniel Sokol & Feng Zhu*
 
Apple’s iOS 14 update represents an anti-competitive strategy disguised as a privacy-protecting measure. Apple now prohibits non-Apple apps from using information essential to providing relevant, personalized advertising, without explicit user opt-in. And users may opt-in only after they are shown an ominous and misleading prompt about “tracking,” one that Apple’s own apps and services need not display, because consumers are automatically “opted in” to Apple’s own tracking. Apple’s policy will have the pernicious effects of enhancing the dominance of iOS among mobile operating systems (“OSs”) and the dominance of its own apps and services within the iOS ecosystem, while reducing consumer choice and devastating the free-app ecosystem.
  
Entrenching Dominance in the Mobile OS Market 
Apple’s conduct will entrench its dominance in the mobile OS market and over the iOS ecosystem; and it will reduce the availability of the ad-supported (i.e. free) business model in favor of fee-supported models that uniquely benefit Apple in several ways.
  
iOS 14 Policy Changes 
Apple will prohibit third-party apps from engaging in broad categories of data use — unilaterally defined by Apple as “tracking” — unless users explicitly “opt in.” Notably, this requirement does not apply to Apple’s own apps and services. As a result:

Ad publishers’ and advertisers’ ability to match consumers with relevant ads and to measure consumers’ responses to ads will be substantially diminished, fundamentally undermining the ad-supported business model.
Apple’s own advertising service will play by an entirely different set of rules, giving Apple a significant advantage over competitors, whom Apple requires to adhere to the new policy.

  
Apple Wins. Everyone Else Loses. 
Apple’s iOS 14 policy changes will benefit Apple — and only Apple — by:

Substantially weakening the ads ecosystem, and shifting previously “free” (ad-supported) apps to the paid model, i.e. charging consumers fees subject to Apple’s 15–30 percent surcharge;
Favoring Apple’s own apps by making third-party apps that migrate to the paid model more expensive relative to Apple’s own apps, which are not subject to Apple’s 15–30 percent surcharge, and making it difficult for third-party apps that will be unable to migrate to the paid model to sustain their businesses;
Decreasing competition for Apple’s own advertising service; and
Increasing the costs to consumers of switching from iOS to another mobile OS (such as Android).

Apple’s conduct will harm app developers, advertisers, consumers, and the entire ads ecosystem. Notably:

The ominous and misleading prompt that Apple requires apps to display is expected to result in low opt-in rates, which will in turn severely diminish developers’ ability to monetize their apps through personalized ads. (Businesses don’t want to pay to show ads that consumers are likely to deem irrelevant.) The impact of this action on small and medium-sized businesses — which rely heavily on personalized advertising — will be severe;
Rival ad platforms’ ability to compete against Apple’s advertising service will be reduced;
Consumers will lose many valued free services they get from ad-supported apps; and
Consumers will be left with less relevant (but not necessarily fewer) ads; fewer (free) apps from which to choose; and degraded experiences for the apps that remain.

 
Personalized Advertising and the Free and Open Internet
A free and open internet is the backbone of the U.S. economy and society. Over 4 billion people globally use the internet on a daily basis, and 85 percent of Americans go online daily.1 Businesses and consumers alike rely on the internet, and more specifically, on mobile devices, to communicate with one another, to keep themselves informed about news and current events, and to engage in commerce in a quick and effective way. The past year underscored the importance of the open internet, which allowed businesses and individuals to maintain and create connections in the midst of the global pandemic. Many local brick-and-mortar businesses, for instance, opened online storefronts in order to connect with consumers who were unable to shop in person.
Keeping intact the internet’s ability to connect people and businesses is therefore of paramount importance. Advertising — especially personalized advertising — is a key part of that dynamic. Personalized advertising delivers value to consumers and businesses by connecting them to the right products and services. Additionally, personalized advertising brings value to consumers in the form of free (or significantly lower cost) products, apps, and services.
A new update to Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS 14, threatens to diminish the value that the free internet, subsidized by personalized advertising, provides. Under the mantle of privacy, Apple’s update imposes excessive restrictions on alternative business models and distorts competition. At a high level, Apple’s iOS 14 update prohibits apps from engaging in broad categories of data use unless users opt-in — often not only once but twice — to prompts requesting “permission to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.” The categories of data use that Apple prohibits encompass many uses that would not qualify as “tracking” as the term is commonly understood (i.e. following a user around the internet). Apple does not apply these changes evenhandedly. Apple’s iOS 14 update does not apply to Apple’s own services, including its own apps and proprietary ads product.
Moreover, Apple’s update goes beyond any legitimate protection of users’ privacy interests. Through its so-called “privacy” update, Apple uses its market power for mobile OSs in a way that reduces consumer choice. To take but one example, if Apple can reduce the number of free news apps available to end users, that forces readers to use either paid news apps or Apple’s competing news aggregation service (Apple News). That puts Apple, rather than consumers, in charge of curating the news content they see. The update creates significant competitive distortions that, while favoring Apple, will decimate the ad-based business model that enables developers to provide apps at no cost to consumers and simultaneously allows advertisers to reach consumers that would be most interested in their offerings.
Apple’s update also has profound consequences for competition among mobile OSs. By degrading the ad-supported app ecosystem, Apple’s update will steer consumers toward paid apps and Apple’s own apps and services, and developers toward fee-based monetization and distribution through Apple’s aggregation services (e.g. Apple News+ for news and Apple Arcade for games). Unlike third-party ad-supported apps, which can seamlessly transition between mobile operating systems, Apple’s proprietary apps and services are generally unavailable on operating systems other than iOS. As such, Apple’s update — which steers iOS users toward its proprietary apps and services — raises iOS users’ costs of switching to non-Apple devices and entrenches Apple’s iOS monopoly.
Our full-length white paper identifies how Apple’s iOS 14 strategy serves to reinforce Apple’s dominance over the mobile ecosystem by significantly reducing — if not effectively precluding — the ability of third-party apps to create value through personalized advertising. This move to stifle competition is consistent with Apple’s established track record of engaging in conduct that protects and extends the dominance of iOS at the expense of developers, small businesses, and consumers.2
This paper explains: (i) Apple’s dominance in mobile OSs and the competitive dynamics in the industry, including the critical role that personalized advertising plays in today’s mobile app ecosystem; (ii) how Apple’s iOS 14 updates dramatically alter today’s mobile OS ecosystem, wrongfully preference Apple’s own products and services, and help Apple protect and augment its dominance over iOS and more broadly over mobile OSs; and (iii) why such actions harm competition, and by extension, iOS users and consumers more broadly.3
 
Conclusion
While thinly veiled as a privacy-protecting measure, Apple’s iOS 14 policy changes harm the entire ad-supported ecosystem — from developers to advertisers to end consumers. By sharply limiting the ability of third-party apps to create value through personalized advertising, Apple’s policy changes undermine competition: They threaten to enhance the dominance of Apple’s apps and services within iOS, to weaken independent advertising services to the benefit of Apple’s own advertising service, and to entrench iOS’s dominance among mobile operating systems by raising the costs to iOS users of switching to another mobile OS. Apple’s policy changes will have an outsized impact on particularly vulnerable businesses: small- and medium-sized businesses, which rely heavily on personalized advertising, and developers of newer apps that may be unable to transition from ad-supported to paid business models. Apple’s conduct will leave consumers with fewer choices for apps and services and, by framing choices about personalized advertising in stark, biased, and misleading terms, diminish consumers’ abilities to make meaningful and informed choices about data use. Without convincing explanations of how its policy changes represent the least competition-restrictive means of enhancing consumer privacy and why those changes do not apply to Apple’s own apps and services, Apple may have a hard time justifying its exclusionary conduct.

883,"May 26, 2021",New Antitrust Suit Claims Apple Monopolizes Heart-Rate Tech,"


A Silicon Valley company has filed an antitrust lawsuit accusing Apple of cornering the market for heart-rate monitoring technology for the Apple Watch, reported Reuters.
In a complaint filed late on Tuesday night, May 25, AliveCor claimed that Apple shut out rivals by changing the heart-rate algorithm on its watch’s operating system, making rival technology incompatible.
AliveCor sells KardiaBand, an Apple Watch wristband capable of recording an electrocardiogram, and SmartRhythm, an app that alerts users to irregular heartbeats.
The privately held company accused Apple, whose market value exceeds US$2 trillion, of quietly “working in the background” to copy its ability to record an ECG on the Apple Watch, and to provide a separate app for heart-rate analysis.
“As it has done multiple times over the years in other markets, Apple decided that it would not accept competition on the merits,” AliveCor stated in its complaint filed in San Francisco federal court.

884,"May 24, 2021",Closing Arguments Completed In Apple-Epic Antitrust Case,"


Apple & Epic made their final pitch to a federal judge Monday, May 24, Epic looks to curb the market power of the App Store while the iPhone maker pleaded to leave its marketplace for 2 million apps undisturbed, reported Bloomberg.
US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers heard closing arguments Monday from attorneys for the creator of the blockbuster game Fortnite and the iPhone maker in a case that threatens to upend the how the US$142 billion world of mobile applications is managed.
Reprising the themes of a three-week trial in Oakland, California, the lawyers debated a set of topics, including the scope of the market in which Epic claims Apple wields power and whether Apple’s tight controls on its store hurts developers and users. Gonzalez Rogers, who is deciding the case without a jury, said she hopes to deliver a ruling as soon as possible but she didn’t specify a date.
After aggressively questioning Apple CEO Officer Tim Cook Friday in his first time testifying as a witness, the judge on Monday asked how Apple’s practice of taking a 30% commission from developers for in-app purchases made through its App Store has remained unchanged since the store opened in 2008.
“If there was real competition, that number would move and it hasn’t,” Gonzalez Rogers said. “If the relevant market here includes developer-side competition, so far there doesn’t seem to be anything that is in the market itself that is pressuring Apple to compete for developers.”
Apple’s lawyer Daniel Swanson said that Apple has improved its device quality even as its developer commission rate stayed the same. Games played on Apple’s iOS operating system can “hold their own” with some of the best games on consoles and PCs, Swanson said. “That is quality competition.”
Epic sued Apple in August, after the iPhone-maker removed Fortnite from its App Store because the gaming company created a workaround so it wouldn’t have to continue paying a 30% fee on customers’ in-app purchases. The case has drawn interest across Silicon Valley, with everyone from Microsoft Corp. to Nvidia Corp. weighing into the fight. In November, Apple sliced its revenue cut from 30% to 15% for developers who generate up to US$1 million in revenue.

885,"May 21, 2021",Apple CEO Tim Cook Testifies At Epic Games Antitrust Suit,"


Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook took the witness stand Friday in a court battle that could decide a key pillar of his growth strategy for the company, reported The Wall Street Journal.
He came to rebut claims by “Fortnite” creator Epic Games Inc. that the tech giant is a monopolist, in a closely watched case that could reverberate around the world as lawmakers and regulators question the might of the world’s most valuable company.
“We’re not thinking about the money at all, we’re thinking about the user,” Mr. Cook said.
With the bench trial in Oakland, Calif., nearing its expected end on Monday, Mr. Cook followed other Apple executives this week who tried to counter arguments by Epic that Apple improperly prohibits competing app stores on the iPhone and forces in-app purchases for digital payments through its own system that takes as much as a 30% cut.
Mr. Cook began testifying around 8:15 a.m. local time by discussing Apple’s commitment to security and privacy—a familiar theme for the CEO—and his belief that third-party developers with their own app stores aren’t motivated to match the level of user protection that Apple provides with its App Store.
He noted that Apple reviews about 100,000 apps a week and rejects about 40,000 for various reasons.
“You can imagine if you turned the review off how long that it would take the App Store to just become a toxic kind of mess,” Mr. Cook said. “It would be terrible for the user, but it also would be terrible for the developer because the developer depends on the store being a safe and trusted place where customers want to come and feel good about transacting.”
Apple’s case that it isn’t a monopoly has relied on citing Android phones, personal computers and videogame consoles as additional ways for Epic to distribute its “Fortnite’’ game, and underscoring that other platforms collect a similar commission.

886,"May 18, 2021",EU Apple Pay Probe Moves Forward,"


Apple’s antitrust woes are continuing to pile up as the EU’s competition commissioner says the bloc will press on with a probe into Apple Pay, reported Bloomberg.
While Apple’s attention turned to a California court clash with Epic Games, Europe’s top antitrust enforcer issued a reminder that the tech giant’s legal battles across the Atlantic are also heating up. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager warned that a probe into the company’s Apple Pay product is moving ahead on top of an investigation — escalated last month — into how the iPhone maker requires software developers to use its in-app purchasing system.
In an interview, Vestager said that the Apple Pay investigation was “quite advanced” and “something that we’re pushing forward.”
The EU has announced a formal investigation into possible antitrust practices carried out by Apple, with regards to both Apple Pay and the App Store.
In a press release the European Commission stated: The European Commission has opened a formal antitrust investigation to assess whether Apple’s conduct in connection with Apple Pay violates EU competition rules. The investigation concerns Apple’s terms, conditions and other measures for integrating Apple Pay in merchant apps and websites on iPhones and iPads, Apple’s limitation of access to the Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality (“tap and go”) on iPhones for payments in stores, and alleged refusals of access to Apple Pay.

887,"May 17, 2021","Tim Cook To Testify In Epic, Apple Case","


Apple gets its turn this week to mount a courtroom defense against Epic Games’s antitrust claims, preparing to bring in its most powerful spokesman: Tim Cook.
According to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Cook, a guarded CEO who is used to carefully orchestrated public appearances, is set to testify in a trial that, regardless of the verdict, could prove to be one of the most consequential for the iPhone maker as it faces accusations it denies of abusing its market power.
Approaching the 10th anniversary of taking over as CEO, Mr. Cook is no stranger to high-profile, make-or-break moments for Apple. A polished public speaker, he has twice testified before Congress, but has never appeared on a witness stand in a trial where his words could sway a judge for or against the company.
His testimony is likely to be the most detailed public discussion he will give on a subject that is likely to loom over Apple for years to come. Mr. Cook has been preparing for the trial, according to a person familiar with his efforts. That has included hours of practice rounds from former prosecutors chosen by his legal team to simulate the witness stand.
He is expected to seek to bolster Apple’s argument that it isn’t a monopoly in a case that threatens to unravel its control over the App Store, a key part of Apple’s services business that generated almost US$54 billion last year.
Epic contends Apple has created monopolies by blocking other app stores on the iPhone and requiring apps to use its in-app purchase system to collect digital revenue, allowing it to collect a 30% commission that Epic claims is unfairly high. Apple counters that the commission is fair for the value it has created for developers and users, is in line with what others charge and points to Android devices, computers, and videogame consoles as examples to buttress the claim that it isn’t limiting distribution of Epic’s game “Fortnite.”

888,"May 12, 2021",Apple Faces New UK Charges Over App Store,"


On Tuesday, May 11, Apple faced possible further court action over its App Store after it was accused of “overcharging” millions of app-purchasers in the UK. 
The claim, filed by digital economy expert Rachael Kent but not yet given the greenlight by Britain’s Competition Appeal Tribunal, calls on the US technology giant to repay customers.
As many as 19.6 million UK users could be eligible for compensation totaling up to US$2.1 billion, the file claims.
It comes after Britain’s competition regulator in March launched an investigation into Apple focusing on the US technology giant’s use of its App Store.
Kent, a lecturer at King’s College, University of London, argues that because the App Store is the only way to get apps on to an iPhone or iPad, it is behaving like a monopoly.
“The App Store was a brilliant gateway for a range of interesting and innovative services that millions of us find useful, myself included,” she added in a statement.
“But thirteen years after its launch, it has become the only gateway for millions of consumers.”
Kent said “Apple guards access to the world of apps jealousy, and charges entry and usage fees that are completely unjustified.
“This is the behavior of a monopolist and is unacceptable.”
Responding to the accusations, Apple described the planned lawsuit as “meritless,” pointing to the company’s “unwavering commitment to consumers and the many benefits the App Store has delivered to the UK’s innovation economy.”

889,"May 10, 2021",EC Provides Apple With “Statement Of Objections” Over App Store Rules ,"


The European Commission has provided Apple with its preliminary opinion that it “distorted competition” in the music streaming space since it took advantage of its “dominant position” in the distribution of music streaming programs by the way of its App Store.
The Commission “takes issue” with the required use of Apple’s in-app purchasing technology by music streaming app developers to provide users with their apps through the App Store. It is also “concerned” that the firm puts some limitations on the developers from telling Apple tablet and smartphone users about different buying options that provide lower prices, according to a statement.
“By setting strict rules on the App store that disadvantage competing music streaming services, Apple deprives users of cheaper music streaming choices and distorts competition,” Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager said in the statement.
The Commission preliminary found that Apple has a dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps through its App Store. For app developers, the App Store is the sole gateway to consumers using Apple’s smart mobile devices running on Apple’s smart mobile operating system iOS. Apple’s devices and software form a “closed ecosystem” in which Apple controls every aspect of the user experience for iPhones and iPads.

Las oficinas de Microsoft en China fueron inspeccionadas por las autoridades en julio de 2014, repitiéndose en agosto del mismo año, como parte de una investigación gubernamental en torno a acusaciones de infracciones a la ley de competencia. A casi dos años del hecho, las pesquisas continúan. Ésta semana la CEO de Microsoft, Satya Nadella, se dirige a Beijing para reunirse con funcionarios del gobierno para tratar el tema de la persistente investigación.
Microsoft ha declarado su intención de colaborar de lleno con las autoridades de la Administración del Estado para la Industria y Comercio (SAIC) durante su investigación. Durante las etapas iniciales del proceso, la SAIC habría dicho que Microsoft no había mostrado “total transparencia” en sus declaraciones de ventas en China. En la versión de Microsoft, las objeciones del SAIC se refieren a los programas de software empaquetados como parte de Windows y Office, así como ciertos problemas de compatibilidad y verificación de archivos. 
En enero de este año la SAIC exigió a Microsoft una explicación formal para resolver “problemas importantes” descubiertos durante su revisión inicial de datos digitales.

Microsoft’s offices in China were raided by authorities in July 2014, and again the following month, as part of a government investigation into alleged antitrust violations. Almost two years later, the probe continues to drag on.
This week, the company’s CEO, Satya Nadella, is visiting Beijing, and according to Reuters – citing an unnamed source – he will be meeting government officials during his trip to discuss the ongoing investigation.
Ever since details of the antitrust investigation by China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) became public, Microsoft has declared its intention to cooperate fully with authorities.
Early in the investigation, SAIC claimed that Microsoft had not been ‘fully transparent’ in declaring its sales data in China. According to Microsoft, the SAIC’s concerns are connected with software bundling related to Windows and Office, as well as issues of compatibility and ‘file verification’.
In January of this year, SAIC demanded that Microsoft provide an explanation for “major issues”uncovered by its examination of certain digital data.

Xiaomi has sealed a deal to buy some 1,500 patents from Microsoft, a move that will help the Chinese smartphone maker expand exports and earn the US technology giant some badly needed goodwill in Beijing.
The transaction addresses a key weakness facing Xiaomi, which is seeking to sell its devices in countries outside its home market but has been hindered by its relative lack of intellectual property to fend off lawsuits.
“In terms of patents we are a young company,” Xiaomi said on Wednesday, adding that the Microsoft deal is “a big milestone for us. It will help us with operations in new markets.”
The agreement comes on the eve of a visit to Beijing by Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella. The US company is still the subject of an antitrust investigation in China over bundling of software, with its offices raided by Chinese authorities in July 2014.
The patent deal includes Xiaomi installing Microsoft’s Office and Skype software on its phones. Financial terms were not made public.
Xiang Wang, senior vice-president, said Xiaomi was “excited” to be working with Microsoft and that the deal demonstrated the Chinese company “is looking to build sustainable, long-term partnerships with global technology leaders”.

Microsoft has withdrawn its regulatory complaints against Google across the globe, matter of months after Redmond retreated from its fight over the ad giant’s alleged abuse of dominance in the search market in Europe.
A spokesperson for the European Commission’s competition chief Margrethe Vestager confirmed to Ars that her office was aware of Microsoft’s decision to back out of the case.
ICOMP lobby group’s long-running campaign against search and ad giant collapses.
“The Commission takes note of the announcement. We continue to investigate the conduct of Google as part of our ongoing formal probes, based on the facts, the evidence and EU law. The substantive analysis in an antitrust case is not affected by the number of complainants nor their identity,” Brussels’ spokesperson Ricardo Cardoso told Ars.
Microsoft first filed a complaint against Google’s alleged anti-competitive search business practices in Europe a little over five years ago in March 2011. The software giant said in a statement: “Microsoft has agreed to withdraw its regulatory complaints against Google, reflecting our changing legal priorities. We will continue to focus on competing vigorously for business and for customers.”

894,"April 19, 2016","US: Microsoft antitrust suit against InterDigital stands, Judge says","
US District Court for the District of Delaware denied InterDigital’s motion to dismiss an antitrust suit filed by Microsoft. In the suit, Microsoft alleged that InterDigital engaged in an unlawful scheme to acquire and exploit monopoly power over standard essential patents required for 3G and 4G cellular devices. Specifically, Microsoft asserted that InterDigital falsely promised to license its 3G and 4G SEPs on Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory terms in order to ensure its SEPs were included in standards set by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute.
According to the complaint, InterDigital failed to live up to its commitment to FRAND licensing terms, and instead acquired monopoly power in the 3G and 4G cellular technology markets and used that power to demand supra-competitive royalties, “double-dip” royalty demands, and has pursued “baseless” International Trade Commission litigation against Microsoft and others.
In its motion to dismiss, InterDigital asserted that Microsoft failed to adequately plead a Sherman Act § 2 monopolization claim, namely that Microsoft failed to show that InterDigital possessed and exercised monopoly power and failed to adequately allege injury. The court disagreed, finding Microsoft’s allegations to be materially similar to those found to be sufficient by the Third Circuit in Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm . With respect to monopoly power, the court found that Microsoft’s allegations as to the necessary technology standards, market entry barriers, and InterDigital’s market share to be sufficient. The court found that allegations of an “intentional false promise” to license technology on FRAND terms, which was relied upon in selecting the technology for inclusion in mandatory standards, and breach of such promise was “sufficient to show anticompetitive conduct.”

895,"March 21, 2016",Microsoft after Fifteen Years,"
Keith N. Hylton, March 20, 2016
United States v. Microsoft Corp. (Microsoft III) is now fifteen years old, and that I would write such a long introduction to a reprint of significant portions from the opinion is a sign its significance has not died out. Just the opposite, I think it will become more significant in the near future, and not only because of its impact on U.S. antitrust law. The decision lays the groundwork for international enforcement of antitrust in high technology markets, at least as we have come to know them, and this is likely to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future.
As for U.S. law, it has become increasingly clear that Microsoft III is the second most important monopolization decision after Learned Hand’s United States v. Alcoa. To be sure, Alcoa must and will always be the most important Section 2 opinion because it sets the foundational principles for modern (post-1945) monopolization law. Judge Hand overturned a doctrinal framework that had induced a passive approach to antitrust enforcement against dominant firms and replaced with a framework that enabled and encouraged aggressive antitrust enforcement. Microsoft has had a comparatively limited impact, but it clarifies and updates the monopolization standard and constrains judges, and in these senses fundamentally alters the law from Alcoa.

Microsoft-backed lobby group ICOMP’s long-running fight against Google’s search dominance in the European Union has collapsed amid accusations that its members have been silenced.
Ars Tecnica reported that members including UK-based price comparison site Foundem—the original complainant in the antitrust case against Google—resigned from ICOMP after Microsoft backed away from what had been a dogged campaign against its search rival in Europe. ICOMP was founded in 2008 to fight for an “online competitive marketplace.”
In a letter from Foundem to ICOMP—seen by Ars—the company said: “In our view, an ICOMP that is prohibited from commenting on Google’s immensely damaging business practices is an ICOMP working against, rather than for, the interests of a fair, competitive online marketplace.”

This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle
William Page, Jul 13, 2009
The Department of Justice’s Section 2 Report (“Report”) considered in great detail how courts should best go about identifying exclusionary conduct and how they should best remedy that kind of conduct once they found it. Even though the new Assistant Attorney General has now withdrawn the Report as an official statement of Antitrust Division policy, the questions the Report addressed remain for the new administration. In this essay, I will comment on two subsidiary but nonetheless critical subjects that the DOJ addressed in the Report: general (as opposed to practice-specific) standards of exclusion and affirmative-obligation (as opposed to prohibitory) remedies. In both instances, my observations will draw on the experience of United States v. Microsoft; the DOJ’s last and still pending monopolization case. The article is an adaption of a posting originally presented in a Section 2 Symposium on the blog site, Truth on the Market, available online at TruthOnTheMarket.

Italy’s antitrust regulator has started proceedings to fine Google for allegedly restrictive clauses in the terms of service consumers have to accept to use Google Drive, reported Reuters. 
In a filing, the antitrust said the proceedings had to be wrapped up within 120 days. 
The authority is concerned that the services fail to adequately explain how user data will be collected and used for commercial purposes. It’s also investigating unfair clauses in the services’ contracts, terms that exempt the services from some liability and the prevalence of English versions of contracts over Italian versions.
The authority has launched six investigations in total, including over alleged violations of Italy’s Consumer Rights Directive. Google is being probed over complaints of unfair practices by failing to adequately indicate to users when their data is being collected for commercial purposes.

Google is opening up its payment processor to third-party payment systems in South Korea in order to comply with new mandates in the country, according to a Google Developers blog post.
The change was requested by the Korea Communications Commission (KCC), marking the first time Google has altered its payment policy for a particular country. The KCC asked Google and Apple to submit plans to comply with the new legislation, which prohibits app stores from forcing their payment systems on developers.

“Service fees for distributing apps via Android and Google Play will continue to be based on digital sales on the platform. We recognize, however, that developers will incur costs to support their billing system, so when a user selects alternative billing, we will reduce the developer’s service fee by 4 percent,” Senior Director of Public Policy Wilson White wrote in the blog post.
The majority of developers pay 15% to process payments using Google Play’s billing system but using an alternate gateway, the charge would drop to 11%. Some app categories participating in the Google Media Experience Program that normally pay a 10% service fee would reduce to 6%. Most of South Korea’s new law went into effect in September.
“We respect the decision of the National Assembly, and we are sharing some changes to respond to this new law, including giving developers that sell in-app digital goods and services the option to add an alternative in-app billing system alongside Google Play’s billing system for their users in South Korea,” Google said in a statement, per Reuters.

The Italian watchdog decided non to take any action as under EU laws the case is now out of its responsibility, it said in its weekly bulletin.
The European Commission opened an investigation in June into whether Google distorts competition by favoring its own online advertising technology services to the detriment of rivals, advertisers and online publishers.

906,"October 28, 2021",Report Finds Google Continues To Dominate Australian Searches,"


The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) third Digital Platform Services Inquiry interim report found that Google continues to be the dominant search engine in Australia, with a market share of 94%. Google Search is the default search engine on the two most popular browsers in Australia, Google’s Chrome browser and Apple’s Safari browser, which are pre-installed on most mobile devices in Australia.
The report found that Google’s dominance in general search engine services in Australia is extended and entrenched by the large sums of money it pays to be the default search engine on Apple’s Safari browser, its ownership of Chrome and by the pre-installation and default arrangements it has in place with competing browser suppliers and device manufacturers that use Google’s Android operating system.
“Search engines play a critical role in the digital economy. We are concerned that Google’s dominance and its ability to use its financial resources to fund arrangements to be the default search engine on many devices and other means through which consumers access search, such as browsers, is harming competition and consumers,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.
“Google pays billions of dollars each year for these placements, which illustrates how being the default search engine is extremely valuable to Google’s business model.”

907,"October 25, 2021",Texas Antitrust Suit Says Google Takes Up To 42% From Ads,"


According to a newly unsealed court filing by states Google takes up to 42% of the money paid for digital ads published online. The filing claims the search and advertising giant abuses its monopoly power in online advertising to limit competition and harm consumers, reported Bloomberg. 
The Alphabet unit runs the biggest electronic marketplace in the world, according to the states, processing 11 billion online ad spaces every day through its AdX exchange. 
More daily transactions are made on AdX than on the NYSE and NASDAQ combined,” a group of 16 states and Puerto Rico said in their complaint, saying they were quoting “Google’s own words.”
The document was filed in August, with redactions to shield information that could be commercially sensitive. It was refiled in a mostly un-redacted form Friday, after a judge in Manhattan ruled last week that most of the material should be publicly available.
“Google now uses its immense market power to extract a very high tax of 22 to 42% of the ad dollars otherwise flowing to the countless online publishers and content producers such as online newspapers, cooking websites, and blogs who survive by selling advertisements on their websites and apps,” the states said in the unredacted filing.

A media group which represents the rights management of about 200 German digital press publications, is demanding 420 million from Google by 2022. 
Corint Media is  based on what it pays in Australia (100 million), Canada (400 million) and France, where it was located. Sentenced to pay $500 million. The publishers’ claim is backed by an EU copyright directive and they have already urged Facebook to negotiate as well.
Corint Media’s calculation is based on the remuneration rate set by the arbitration board of the German Patent and Trademark Office, which considered an appropriate royalty rate of up to 11% on Google’s sales volume, which publishers estimate at 9,000 million euros in 2020 for the exploitation of their search engine in the territory .
The rights manager in his accounts is based on what Google has already paid in Australia (100 million) and Canada (400 million) or the judgment to pay 500 million in France
Corint Media also bases its offer “in accordance with payments or claims relating to the use of journalistic content that has become known in other markets, i.e. in Australia about 100 million euros and in Canada about 400 million euros.”.

909,"October 19, 2021",Canadian Watchdog Probes Google Over Advertising Dominance,"


The Canadian Competition Bureau has started a new investigation into whether Google is engaged in anti-competitive behaviour in Canada. The probe focuses on the way ads are sold on its YouTube platform and how the tech giant’s dominance might reduce competition elsewhere in the “ecosystem” of online advertising.
“Specifically, the Commissioner is investigating whether Google is leveraging its market power in the supply of in-stream video advertising space into adjacent advertising technology markets,” Stéphanie Guitard, a senior competition law officer at the bureau, said in affidavit filed in Federal Court this week.
In 2016 a probe into Google’s online search and search advertising was shelved by the Canadian competition watchdog.
The latest inquiry by the Canadian competition watchdog, first reported by Blacklock’s Reporter, an online Ottawa news outlet, was launched in December. According to documents filed in court as part of a process to gather information on the matter from Google, it is focusing on different conduct and more recent developments. These include the “circumstances and motivations for Google’s decision to withhold YouTube video ad inventory” from certain third parties beginning in 2016, according to the documents.

The National Football League has finalized its new 11-year media rights agreement with a pact that will run through 2033 and could be worth over US$100 billion, reported Bloomberg.
The league announced Thursday, March 18, it’s renewing TV rights with all of its existing broadcast partners and adding Amazon Prime Video as an exclusive partner for its Thursday Night Football package. It’s the first time a streaming service will carry a full package of games exclusively. Amazon is paying about US$1 billion per year, according to people familiar with the matter. Amazon’s deal runs 10 years and begins in 2023.
ViacomCBS, Fox, and Comcast (which owns NBCUniversal) are all paying more than US$2 billion per year for their 11-year-long packages, while Disney (which owns ESPN and ABC) will pay around US$2.7 billion annually, according to people familiar with the matter.  Using these numbers, the NFL’s new agreement projects to be more than US$100 billion — the richest US sports league media deal.
ViacomCBS is paying US$2.1 billion for its package and NBCUniversal is paying about US$2 billion, the lowest of any of the partners, but the highest increase over its previous deal, the people said. NBCUniversal paid US$1.1 billion for its previous package, including playoff games.
Fox is also projected to pay over US$2 billion in its new contact, but will save US$660 million as it relinquishes the Thursday Night Football package. Morgan Stanley estimates that contact will be averaging US$400 million in annual losses in 2023 when Fox’s agreement expires.
Disney is paying more and receiving more NFL content, including rights to exclusively air an international game each year, beginning in 2022, one of the people said.  In this pact, the ESPN network keeps the Monday Night Football package and also has rights to air two Super Bowls on its ABC network. Disney can stream all NFL games that air on ABC and ESPN on ESPN+, the league stated.

911,"March 19, 2021",Indian Regulator Uses Reuters As Evidence In Amazon Probe,"


India’s antitrust body on Friday, March 19, told a court that a Reuters report showing Amazon gave preferential treatment to a small group of sellers on its India platform corroborated evidence it had received and which had triggered an investigation of the US e-commerce giant.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) announced in January 2020 that it was investigating Amazon and Walmart Inc’s Flipkart following a complaint from a trader group that they were promoting preferred sellers. But the probe into alleged violations of competition law was put on hold as the two firms mounted a court challenge.
While arguing on Friday for restarting the probe, Madhavi Goradia Divan, an Additional Solicitor General of India representing the CCI, read parts of the Reuters report to the judge in the Karnataka High Court, saying it “corroborates what was said” in the original complaint.
The Reuters story, which was published last month, was based on internal Amazon documents dated between 2012 and 2019. It revealed that Amazon for years helped a small number of sellers prosper on its platform, giving them discounted fees and helping one cut special deals with big tech manufacturers.

912,"March 11, 2021",Brussels Is Struggling To Build Amazon Antitrust Case,"


Regulators in Brussels are struggling to gather enough evidence to bring antitrust charges against Amazon, despite working on the landmark case for nearly two years, reported The Financial Times.
In July 2019, EU regulators accused the online retailer of manipulating its algorithm to boost its own products “artificially” over its rivals’. As a result, they alleged, users often end up buying lower-quality products at a higher price.
But EU officials are still struggling to understand how Amazon’s algorithm works, despite sending a series of detailed questions to the company about the criteria used to boost a product’s visibility, according to people familiar with the matter.
These people added that officials are also unlikely to be able to view the online retailer’s proprietary code directly to build their case, owing to legal barriers around trade secrets.
People noted that the EU’s case against Amazon is proceeding more slowly than other comparable investigations. The bloc is already set to bring charges against Apple over alleged abuse of its dominant platform in music streaming, for instance, after a two-year-long probe.
The case against Amazon comes as Brussels increases its scrutiny of big tech companies, publishing sweeping new draft laws in December seeking to curb their power.

913,"March 3, 2021",Parler Drops Antitrust Suit Against Amazon,"


Parler has dropped its antitrust lawsuit against its former web host Amazon Web Services (AWS), which in January brought the controversial social-media app offline.
At the time, Amazon claimed that Parler, favored by the far-right, had failed to moderate content that incited violence. Parler disputed the tech giant’s claims, and filed a lawsuit.
On Tuesday, March 2, Parler filed a motion in a Washington federal court to dismiss the case, without giving a reason.
Tuesday was Parler’s deadline to file an amended complaint in its case against AWS, after getting a two-week extension from the court, according to The Verge.
Parler returned online in mid-February with new web host SkySilk, after reportedly being rejected by at least six other large providers.
In the run up to the January 6 Capitol siege, Parler had become a haven for far-right activity and misinformation because of its lax stance on moderating content. During the riots, users cheered the protestors on, and some called for more violence.

An Indian trade association with 150,000 members owning mobile phone stores has asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to probe Amazon’s business practices in the country, Reuters reported on Monday, March 1.
The All India Mobile Retailers Association (AIMRA) sent a letter to Modi and asked the court to institute a daily cap on any one seller’s mobile sales. It further said that Amazon has been extending special treatment to preferred sellers for many years. 
By doing this, Amazon sidestepped India’s strict regulations regarding foreign investors, per Reuters. The letter referred to a Reuters February special report. 
“We were already aware of Amazon’s thought process and strategy,” the letter stated, further indicating that documents show that Amazon is “doing business in India with the strategy of deftly dodging the regulators and politicians.”
According to documents reviewed by Reuters, Amazon assisted some merchants in performing better on its website by reducing fees and helping them negotiate special big tech deals. AIMRA has asked the court to pull the plug on Amazon’s Indian operations until an investigation commences.

An Amazon seller complained to lawmakers Thursday, February 11, of unfair forced arbitration clauses the platform uses to prevent potentially damaging outcomes in court, reported CNBC.
Jacob Weiss, founder and president of home goods retailer OJ Commerce, told the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust that he, like many other e-commerce business owners, relies on Amazon to survive. Because of Amazon’s huge presence in the online shopping market, small sellers have frequently said they feel dependent on the platform to drive sales.
Weiss said that gave him “no choice” but to sign Amazon’s contract allowing him to sell on its platform, which included a forced arbitration clause that also prevented him from bringing class-action cases against the company.
“Amazon’s forced arbitration clauses have made it impossible to get a fair shake,” Weiss told the subcommittee. “The system is rigged against small- to mid-sized online business owners.”

Walmart is buying up the technology and assets behind Thunder, which uses automation to create digital ads. One key goal for the retailer is to bring in more advertising business from small to medium-size businesses (SMBs). The behemoth retailer’s latest move is part of its campaign to take on Amazon’s advertising division, in part by broadcasting what Walmart can do for online sellers.
“Thunder’s technology and team will reduce the time between the idea for an ad and the ad going live for suppliers,” said Janey Whiteside, chief customer officer for Walmart, in a press release. “While we expect our largest suppliers to adopt automation technology fastest, we are building this new platform to scale for Marketplace sellers and suppliers of all sizes.”
Whiteside added that “Thunder technology will be integrated with our display self-serve platform,” and that “Thunder will also increase ad effectiveness over time with creative versioning, testing and optimization.” Over the last two years, she noted, Walmart “has been on a journey to help advertisers run their campaigns more efficiently using self-serve and automation capabilities.”
Last week, on January 28, Walmart renamed its media operations from Walmart Media Group to Walmart Connect. The retailer stated the new name reflects its capacity to connect its 150 million weekly shoppers and advertisers, according to an announcement.
Also last week, Walmart announced a plan to roll out more fulfillment centers at local stores to better serve online buyers, which could be “a compact, modular warehouse built within, or added to, a store.”

Andy Jassy will succeed Jeff Bezos as Amazon’s CEO. Bezos will transition to the role of Executive Chair in the third quarter of 2021. The CEO succession comes at a time of enormous financial and technical strength for Amazon but big antitrust challenges, reported CNBC.
“Andy’s got a promotion and his job now includes testifying to Congress, so good luck with that,” former Amazon VP Tim Bray told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” in an interview Wednesday, February 3. Bray later added, “Andy’s a smart guy. He’s a good leader. I suspect he’ll do well. But let’s not claim it’s going to be an easy job.”

Amazon announced on Tuesday, February 2, that AWS CEO Andy Jassy will replace Jeff Bezos as CEO during the third quarter of this year. Bezos will transition to executive chair of Amazon’s board, reported CNBC.
“I’m excited to announce that this Q3 I’ll transition to Executive Chair of the Amazon Board and Andy Jassy will become CEO,” Bezos wrote in a letter to employees. “In the Exec Chair role, I intend to focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives. Andy is well known inside the company and has been at Amazon almost as long as I have. He will be an outstanding leader, and he has my full confidence.”
Bezos founded Amazon in 1994, and since then has morphed it from an online bookstore into a mega online retailer that sells and delivers all sorts of products all over the world. In January of last year, Amazon surpassed a US$1 trillion market cap under Bezos’ leadership.
Jassy joined Amazon in 1997 and has led Amazon’s Web Services cloud team since its inception.
Here’s the full letter from Bezos to Amazon employees:
Fellow Amazonians:
I’m excited to announce that this Q3 I’ll transition to Executive Chair of the Amazon Board and Andy Jassy will become CEO. In the Exec Chair role, I intend to focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives. Andy is well known inside the company and has been at Amazon almost as long as I have. He will be an outstanding leader, and he has my full confidence.
This journey began some 27 years ago. Amazon was only an idea, and it had no name. The question I was asked most frequently at that time was, “What’s the internet?” Blessedly, I haven’t had to explain that in a long while.
Today, we employ 1.3 million talented, dedicated people, serve hundreds of millions of customers and businesses, and are widely recognized as one of the most successful companies in the world.
How did that happen? Invention. Invention is the root of our success. We’ve done crazy things together, and then made them normal. We pioneered customer reviews, 1-Click, personalized recommendations, Prime’s insanely-fast shipping, Just Walk Out shopping, the Climate Pledge, Kindle, Alexa, marketplace, infrastructure cloud computing, Career Choice, and much more. If you get it right, a few years after a surprising invention, the new thing has become normal. People yawn. And that yawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive.
I don’t know of another company with an invention track record as good as Amazon’s, and I believe we are at our most inventive right now. I hope you are as proud of our inventiveness as I am. I think you should be.
As Amazon became large, we decided to use our scale and scope to lead on important social issues. Two high-impact examples: our $15 minimum wage and the Climate Pledge. In both cases, we staked out leadership positions and then asked others to come along with us. In both cases, it’s working. Other large companies are coming our way. I hope you’re proud of that as well.
I find my work meaningful and fun. I get to work with the smartest, most talented, most ingenious teammates. When times have been good, you’ve been humble. When times have been tough, you’ve been strong and supportive, and we’ve made each other laugh. It is a joy to work on this team.
As much as I still tap dance into the office, I’m excited about this transition. Millions of customers depend on us for our services, and more than a million employees depend on us for their livelihoods. Being the CEO of Amazon is a deep responsibility, and it’s consuming. When you have a responsibility like that, it’s hard to put attention on anything else. As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and my other passions. I’ve never had more energy, and this isn’t about retiring. I’m super passionate about the impact I think these organizations can have.
Amazon couldn’t be better positioned for the future. We are firing on all cylinders, just as the world needs us to. We have things in the pipeline that will continue to astonish. We serve individuals and enterprises, and we’ve pioneered two complete industries and a whole new class of devices. We are leaders in areas as varied as machine learning and logistics, and if an Amazonian’s idea requires yet another new institutional skill, we’re flexible enough and patient enough to learn it.
Keep inventing, and don’t despair when at first the idea looks crazy. Remember to wander. Let curiosity be your compass. It remains Day 1.

Amazon is upping its legal battle against Reliance Retail’s US$3.4 billion acquisition of Future Group’s retail assets. This time around, it is even asking that an Indian court send Future’s Founder Kishore Biyani to prison and seize his assets, Bloomberg reported.
Among other things, Amazon argues that the deal breaches its prior agreements with Future Retail. The eCommerce giant owns a 49% stake in Future Coupons, which owns a 7.3% stake in Future Retail.
Amazon got a Singapore arbitration court to take its side. Now, the eCommerce giant wants India to enforce that Singapore court’s ruling to temporarily halt completion of the deal, Bloomberg reported. The Delhi High Court will hear the matter on Thursday, January 28. Representatives for Amazon in India and Future Group declined to comment to Bloomberg.
The cash-strapped Future Group says it would collapse should the deal with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance fail.
In a big setback for Amazon, the Securities and Exchange Board of India approved the US$3.4 billion deal last week on January 21. Amazon had called on the Indian Securities Board in November to investigate Future Group for insider trading.
Amazon had been pushing Indian regulators to stop Reliance from taking over Future, a supermarket and high-end food store chain with more than 1,500 locations across India.
Now, the Indian securities board has approved the deal, and the Bombay Stock Exchange has said it has no objections to the stock-listing request. Among other things, the deal would transfer Future Group’s retail and wholesale business to Reliance Retail and Fashion Lifestyle, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Retail Ventures. Regulatory battles may remain for the deal — and now Amazon has launched the latest courtroom fight.

921,"December 29, 2020",The FTC’s Facebook Suit: Questions and Answers,"
By: FTC Staff
1. What have you sued Facebook for and why?
We have sued Facebook for illegal monopolization. Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which the FTC enforces through Section 5 of the FTC Act, prohibits companies from using anticompetitive means to acquire or maintain monopoly power. The FTC’s complaint alleges that Facebook has for many years been unlawfully stifling competition and strengthening its monopoly. Facebook’s unlawful practices include acquisitions of two major competitive threats—Instagram and WhatsApp—and practices relating to API access that deter and hinder competition, and contribute to the maintenance of Facebook’s personal social networking monopoly.
2. What relief are you seeking?
We have asked the court to provide whatever relief is necessary to restore competition. That could include divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as injunctive relief preventing Facebook from pursuing anticompetitive practices like the use of anticompetitive conditions on API access. The court has broad remedial powers, and as litigation proceeds we will develop our understanding of what an appropriate remedial package would look like.
3. What comes next?
Facebook must now either answer our complaint or move to dismiss it.
4. Doesn’t Facebook compete with many other online companies? Isn’t competition just a click away?
No. Our lengthy investigation revealed—and the Complaint alleges—that there is a distinct market for personal social networking: that is, online services that enable and are used by people to maintain personal relationships and share experiences with friends, family, and other personal connections in a shared social space. Facebook holds monopoly power in that personal social networking market.  Other online services are not reasonably substitutable for personal social networking services…

927,"December 15, 2020",How the Facebook Case Could Revitalize Our Broken Antitrust Law,"


By Chris Sagers, SLATE
For years, critics of Silicon Valley have been talking about a coming “techlash” in American antitrust law, but it’s only in recent months that we’ve seen what one looks like. Last week, the Federal Trade Commission and a coalition of nearly every U.S. state filed antitrust suits against Facebook, following pending cases by the Justice Department against Google (to crack its dominance in search) and by Epic Games against Apple (to break its grip on the App Store). The Facebook suits are huge and ambitious, seeking to slice off the company’s largest subsidiaries. They’re also probably the most technically important. In a few specific ways, they could revitalize the tools of a broader style of antitrust enforcement.
For a long time, government has left most of our antitrust law unused, focusing on only the narrowest kinds of misbehavior—the most serious, explicit conspiracies among separate firms. That conduct is the easiest to challenge, because our very conservative courts have made it hard to use the rest of the law, which consists mainly of a rule against anti-competitive mergers and another rule against exclusion of competitors by monopolists. You can’t do this and expect to have a working competition policy, one that protects average folks from monopolies and checks concentrated power. If the only thing you ever stop is conspiracy, firms just find other ways to squeeze the same money out of people’s wallets.
The long, detailed Facebook complaints tell a very compelling story of anti-competitive animus and abuse, documented with a rich collection of internal communications, including many damaging admissions by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the company’s second-in-command, Sheryl Sandberg, as well as dozens of other juicy zingers that would make any defense attorney impulsively clench. One Facebook engineer, in an email quoted in the complaint, wrote that the company’s abuses of smaller tech firms “just makes me feel like a bad person.”
The case focuses on two theories of liability that have been gathering dust for decades: “nonhorizontal mergers” and “unilateral refusals to deal.” The revitalization of either would be very desirable for the law.
American law has come to view one firm buying another as essentially never a concern unless they compete “horizontally”—that is, they currently sell the same goods to the same customers. The acquisitions that make up the primary challenge in the Facebook suits—Facebook’s purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp—were not horizontal, or at least they didn’t look like it at the time. But they were neutralizations of nascent, developing threats. The law’s decadeslong indifference to such deals is coming to seem like a major mistake, not just in Silicon Valley but throughout the economy.

In a press release published Monday, the FTC announced that it is ordering nine social media and video streaming companies, including Amazon, TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, Discord, Facebook, Reddit, Snap, Twitter, WhatsApp, and YouTube,  to provide data on how they collect and use personal information provided by their users. The companies have 45 days to respond.
The FTC’s orders were authorized as part of a wide-ranging investigative inquiry and do not serve specific law enforcement purposes. However, the FTC could pursue enforcement actions should it find wrongful behavior throughout the study. In the agency’s Monday orders, the FTC requested that the companies provide information related to how they collect personal data, how that data determines which ads and content users are shown, and whether they “apply algorithms or data analytics to personal information.”
The Commission voted 4-1 to approve the orders with Commissioner Noah Phillips dissenting, saying that the probe was too wide-ranging to produce useful results. 
“These digital products may have launched with the simple goal of connecting people or fostering creativity. But, in the decades since, the industry model has shifted from supporting users’ activities to monetizing them,” three FTC commissioners who voted to approve the orders said in a joint statement Monday. “This transition has been fueled by the industry’s increasing intrusion into our private lives.”

929,"December 13, 2020",Facebook COO Sandberg Talks Antitrust Suits,"


Sheryl Sandberg, chief operations officer of Facebook, is pushing back against two antitrust lawsuits filed against the social media giant, CNBC reported on Friday, December 11.
The lawsuits filed this week could break up Facebook’s ownership of Instagram, acquired in 2012, and WhatsApp, snapped up in 2014. Sandberg said approved mergers shouldn’t later be revoked. 
“Those acquisitions were cleared and if you can buy a company, and eight years, 10 years later, the government can clear them and unwind it — that’s going to be a really big chilling problem for American business, we are not going to be competitive around the world,” Sandberg said in an interview with Tamron Hall published on Thursday, per CNBC.
Sandberg also said that contrary to claims, Facebook has competition like TikTok, SnapChat, and others.
“There’s our services but there’s iMessage, there’s TikTok, there’s Snapchat, many of which have grown very big, very quickly,” Sandberg said. “I can’t get my own kids to post on Instagram because they’re so busy on Snapchat and TikTok. You know, if you want to get electricity today for your home, you’ve got one choice, but you’ve got lots of choice for your time and attention.”
Facebook is facing an antitrust lawsuit that was filed on Wednesday, December 9, by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 46 states. The suit accuses Facebook of maintaining its monopoly by engaging in anticompetitive practices.

930,"May 10, 2021",ACCC Seeks To Appear In Epic v. Apple Appeal,"


The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has sought leave to appear at the hearing of Epic Games’ appeal to the Full Federal Court against an earlier Court decision to stay Epic’s proceedings against Apple.
The ACCC seeks the Court’s leave to appear as an amicus curiae (‘friend of the Court’), or to intervene as a non-party, to make submissions to the Full Court about the public policy in favour of disputes involving Australia’s competition laws being heard and determined by Australian courts.
Epic instituted proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia against Apple in November 2020, making allegations that Apple had engaged in anti-competitive conduct in breach of the Competition and Consumer Act (CCA) in relation to the App Store.
Apple sought a stay of these proceedings on the grounds that the commercial agreement between Apple and Epic requires all disputes between the parties to be determined in courts in the Northern District of California in the United States.
On April 9, 2021, Justice Perram granted the stay of the proceedings sought by Apple, on the basis that he did not consider Epic had shown there were strong reasons not to grant the stay. In reaching this conclusion, he indicated that he was troubled by the outcome, which would result in Epic’s claims under Australian competition law being determined by a foreign court.
Epic has appealed from that decision, and an expedited hearing before the Full Federal Court has been fixed for June 9, 2021.
“The ACCC has taken the unusual step of seeking leave to appear in this appeal because the stay application raises significant public policy issues about which, as the statutory agency responsible for administering Australia’s competition law, we believe we can be of assistance to the Court,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.
“This is a case filed in an Australian Court involving Australian consumers and raising significant issues under Australia’s competition laws. We believe it is in the public interest for significant competition law cases such as this case to be determined by Australian courts, given the outcome of such cases can have significant implications for the broader Australian economy.”

931,"May 9, 2021",FTC Report Calls Apple’s Repair Policies Anti-Competitive,"


Apple was called out in a U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report for its alleged “anti-competitive repair restrictions” that stifle independent repair businesses from fixing its devices, 9to5Mac reported.
The FTC said in its report that repair restrictions have a negative effect on small businesses as well as consumers. The agency is calling for the enforcement of laws already on the books and for the addition and implementation of new mandates.
The report indicates that repair businesses can’t compete when companies develop products that are not easily remedied or flat-out can’t economically be fixed. Consumers are also disadvantaged because lack of choice can inflate repair prices to a point where it doesn’t economically add up.
By way of example, Apple has strict requirements for any independent computer repair shop looking to work on MacBooks, iPhones and other Apple devices. Repair technicians could be faced with random audits and inspections by Apple for up to five years,the news outlet reported.
Further, Apple’s service manuals are not easily obtained and when remedies for issues are shared online, the company has a history of crying foul over copyright infringement. Battery replacement for iPhones has also been an issue and has caused people to buy a new device rather than attempt to replace an expensive battery, per the report. 
Aside from being cost-prohibitive, Apple’s repair conventions are also bad for the environment and the company’s practice of integrating components to the logic board adds to the cost of a repair or makes it not practical to consider. 
Apple has been under fire in the courts in the U.S. and abroad, with an antitrust trial last month attended by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney stemming from an incident in 2020 regarding Apple’s App Store 30 percent fees.

932,"May 9, 2021","Amazon, Tile Team Up To Compete With Apple AirTags","


Amazon has announced new partnerships in hopes of enhancing its connected devices to compete with products such as Apple AirTags.
The company said Friday it had formed partnerships with Tile, which makes trackers for lost items, and the smart lock maker Level in hopes of using this technology to enhance network tracking based on WiFi and Bluetooth.
“The strength and number of devices on a given tracking network is key to its accuracy,” writes CNBC in the network’s report on the announcement. “That’s part of the reason why many think Apple’s tracking network will be so strong since it relies on more than 1 billion iPhones, iPads and Macs to help with lost item tracking.”
As CNBC noted, Tile has spoken out against Apple’s ventures into lost-item tracking, testifying before Congress that they and other app developers fear Apple’s policies governing third-party apps and hardware accessories.
Last year, Tile accused Apple of tweaking its operating systems by changing default settings and turning off the “always allow” default — which disables third-party tracking tools — while setting its own FindMY app to default to “on.” Apple has denied these allegations.
Apple announced the AirTags last month, its own Tile-like product, as part of its annual Spring Loaded device showcase.
As CNBC notes, “they work in a similar way with iOS devices like iPhones and iPads. Now Tile will connect through a larger technology ecosystem, pitting Amazon and Apple against each other in a new front of connected devices.”
Amazon says the new partnerships will let it upgrade its Sidewalk tracking network by allowing Tile and Level devices to connect to Amazon Echo products. Tile will begin working with Amazon devices next month, integrating compatible Echo devices to extend Tile’s network to help users recover lost keys or other items.

By Sarah E. Needleman, Wall Street Journal
The first week of the trial between Epic Games Inc. and Apple Inc. AAPL 0.53% was dominated by why the “Fortnite” creator has challenged the tech giant and how the iPhone maker treats apps looking to join its store.
Epic has accused Apple of violating U.S. antitrust law and sued it in August after the tech giant yanked the developer’s hit videogame “Fortnite” from its App Store. Apple has defended itself by arguing that its app-marketplace policies are fair and that Epic breached a contract applicable to all developers distributing apps on its mobile devices.
The trial, in which U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers will decide the outcome, is slated to run at least three weeks in Oakland, Calif., and could help reshape the multibillion-dollar market for distributing apps on mobile devices.

934,"May 4, 2021",Apple Facing New Antitrust Complaint In Germany Over App Tracking,"


Following a recent antitrust complaint in France, Apple’s new App Tracking Transparency framework is facing a similar challenge in Germany. 
A coalition of industry associations, collectively representing many of the country’s leading media and tech companies, is centering its complaint on the expected severe loss of revenue for the targeted advertising industry and an expected passing on of those costs to consumers; in other words, apps that were previously free with advertising will have to shift to paid models to survive, or be forced to abandon iOS.
The antitrust complaint represents a wide variety of companies in the advertising, tech, and media industries, including Facebook and Axel Springer SE (Europe’s largest digital news publishing house). It was filed with the Bundeskartellamt, Germany’s competition regulator, by the German Advertising Federation.
The German companies contend that they expect revenue to drop due to 60% due to the recent implementation of the final stage of the App Tracking Transparency framework, which requires apps to obtain permission to track users through a mandatory pop-up presented upon download.
The complaint also claims that taking consent-free app tracking off the table will harm consumers, given that apps that relied on it for revenue will either need to start asking for some sort of direct payment or may go out of business entirely.

“Fortnite” maker Epic Games and Apple kicked off their three-week trial Monday, April 3, in a case that could have far reaching implications for the iPhone maker’s business model and US antitrust law, reported The Washington Post.
In opening statements in a federal courthouse in Oakland, California, Epic painted Apple as a monopolist that concocted a plan to lure software developers and customers into iOS.
According to The Washington Post, Apple painted Epic as an opportunist looking to cut costs with a court case that could damage iOS and endanger consumers by forcing allowing harmful apps onto their phones.
While both sides trade blows, US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who will decide the case, must analyze whether iOS falls into the strict legal definition of a monopoly, and then whether Apple’s business practices amount to an abuse of monopoly power, as Epic alleges.
Apple argues that allowing apps on its devices that are not subject to its restrictions would compromise the security and privacy of its ecosystem. Additionally, it argues that it is competing in a massive video game market of which it is only a small part, therefore it has no monopoly and cannot abuse such a position.

European Union regulators accused Apple on Friday, April 30, of violating the bloc’s antitrust laws, alleging the iPhone maker distorts competition for music streaming by imposing unfair rules for rival services in its App Store.
The EU’s executive Commission stated it objected to Apple’s rules for music streaming services that compete with its Apple Music service, claiming they end up costing consumers more and limiting their choices.
The charges underscore the long-running feud over app payments between Apple and popular music streaming service Spotify, which filed a complaint that sparked the investigation – one of four the company is facing from the EU. Regulators in Brussels are also investigating other big US tech companies like Amazon and Google, amid a growing global movement to rein in their power.
The EU’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, outlined two main concerns. One centers on Apple’s practice of forcing app developers selling digital content to use its in-house payment system, which charges a 30% commission on all subscriptions.

Australia’s competition watchdog announced on Wednesday, April 28, that regulation may be required to address the significant market power app stores owned by Alphabet’s Google and Apple have if they do not take steps to assuage concerns.
The global dominance of Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store has been criticized by some app makers for mandatory revenue sharing payments and strict inclusive rules by both companies.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), in a digital platforms services inquiry interim report, stated app developers should be allowed to provide customers with alternative payment options and data collected by Google and Apple should be kept separate from their other operations.
The ACCC also called for consumers to be allowed to change or remove pre-installed or default apps.
“We have identified a number of areas where action is required and have put forward potential measures to address areas of particular concern,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.
“There is a window of opportunity for Apple and Google themselves to take steps to improve outcomes for app developers and consumers.”

938,"April 27, 2021",German Media Groups File Antitrust Complaint Against Apple,"


A number of German associations active in the media, internet and advertising industries have filed a complaint against Apple with the Federal Cartel Office, accusing the tech giant of abusing its market position and violating antitrust law with its new “App Tracking Transparency” rules for iOS. 
Apple launched the new feature through an update to its iOS operating system on Monday, April 26. This feature has garnered attention for its requirement that apps gain users’ permission before being able to track them and their activity across the web, limiting the reach and amount of impressions made to help cultivate targeted ads.
Many corporations, both domestic and international, have aired their grievances regarding the update feature. The advertising federation claims that it gives Apple a “one-sided advantage.” Facebook has also pushed back against this new feature as it relies heavily on targeted ads in order to increase impressions and user engagement. These corporations claim that it is harmful to small businesses as well as excludes competitors from getting access to commercially relevant data in the Apple ecosystem.
Apple responded to the complaint by stating, “A user’s data belongs to them and they should get to decide whether to share their data and with whom. With iOS 14.5, we’re giving users the choice of whether or not they want to allow apps to track them by linking their information with data from third parties for advertising, or sharing their information with data brokers.”

Russia’s competition regulator fined Apple 906 million rubles (US$12.1 million) for abusing its market position by favoring its own services on the App Store, adding to the company’s ongoing challenges in the digital distribution area, reported Reuters.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) explained the company is currently appealing an order for it to amend its practices by removing provisions enabling it to reject third-party apps on the App Store for any reason.
Apple’s court challenge also covers a FAS requirement for it to ensure in-house apps are not prioritized over third-party alternatives, along with a stipulation it allows developers to distribute their services through the App Store without restricting specific functions.
The FAS fine and attempts to rein Apple in are the result of an investigation commenced in August 2019 following a complaint from cybersecurity company Kaspersky that Apple stifled competition on the App Store.

940,"December 21, 2015",Microsoft and the Court of First Instance: What Does it All Mean?,"
This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle
Renata Hesse, Oct 03, 2007
As someone who has spent a considerable portion of the last five years working on issues involving Microsoft’s conduct and the competition laws, I read with interest the commentary that followed the issuance of the Court of First Instance’s decision on September 17. Much of the focus of the commentary was on the significance of the decision with respect to the state of “convergence” of U.S. and European Community (Community) competition law relating to unilateral conduct of “dominant” firms. While convergence, or the lack thereof, is obviously a major issue, the decision is also important because of what it reflects about regulatory and judicial views in Europe and the United States on issues at the intersection of intellectual property and competition law. These issues have broader implications than just the Microsoft case.
But first a small point; the standard of review applied by the CFI may have been a significant driver of the outcome. In paragraph 87 of the decision, the CFI states that its review of the “complex economic appraisals” is “necessarily limited to checking whether the relevant rules on procedure and on stating reasons have been complied with, whether the facts have been accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or a misuse of powers.” Similarly, in paragraph 88 of the decision, the CFI notes that “complex technical appraisals  are in principle subject to only limited review by the Court, which means that the Community Courts cannot substitute their own assessment of matters of fact for the Commission’s.” The CFI thus rejected Microsoft’s invitation to perform a “searching inquiry into the soundness of the Commission’s decision” (paragraph 86), opting instead to apply a standard of review akin to an “abuse of discretion” standard in the United States. Regardless of what one thinks of the merits of Microsoft’s appeal to the CFI, application of this standard perhaps doomed it from the start.

941,"December 21, 2015","Strong Spine, Weak Underbelly: The CFI Microsoft Decision","
This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle
Harry First, Sep 28, 2007
INTRODUCTION The CFI’s decision in Microsoft came as something of a surprise. In the run-up to its issuance, commentators had been predicting some sort of “split-the-difference” approach, seeing the Court as most likely upholding the Commission’s decision on Microsoft™ refusal to supply interoperability information to Sun but reversing its decision on Microsoft’s refusal to dis-integrate Windows and the Windows Media Player. I thought the opposite. Immediately after the Commission’s decision in 2004 Microsoft had petitioned the CFI for interim relief to suspend the Commission’s remedial orders. Although the CFI denied the petition, Judge Vesterdorf, President of the CFI, had not dismissed Microsoft’s attack on the interoperability issue out of hand. He recognized that there was a serious dispute on a number of points. Was the protocol information “indispensable” within the meaning of prior case law? Was the assertion of intellectual property rights to these protocols sufficient, in itself, to constitute an “objective justification” for a refusal to provide the information? Microsoft’s contention that the Commission’s decision was wrong on these points, Judge Vesterdorf wrote, “could not be regarded as prima facie unfounded.” I took that to mean that Microsoft had some plausible defenses.
The surprise, to me, was how completely and thoroughly the CFI demolished those defenses. This was an opinion in the style of Woody Hayes (the legendary Ohio State football coach)—three yards and a cloud of dust, relentlessly moving down the field, but with few exciting long passes. On virtually all points of contention, the CFI, after stating the arguments on both sides, agreed with the Commission’s analysis of the applicable case law and how the Commission marshaled the facts to support its conclusions. Indeed, the Court’s language on more than one occasion shows, perhaps, some impatience with Microsoft’s arguments. For example, the Court stated that Microsoft’s complaint about whether the Commission needs to prove more than a “risk” of anticompetitive effect in the targeted market “is purely one of terminology and is wholly irrelevant” (para. 561). “Microsoft’s assertions [about its competitors in the work group server operating system market] ” are scarcely credible (para. 592). Microsoft’s arguments about the exact language of Sun’s request “are purely formal and must be rejected” (para. 773). Microsoft’s arguments that the bundling analysis is inconsistent with Article 82(d) of the EC Treaty “are purely semantic and cannot be accepted” (para. 850). Microsoft’s arguments that tying the Media Player to Windows did not result in foreclosure of competition and that the Commission applied a new and speculative theory are “unfounded and  based on a selective and inaccurate reading of the contested decision” (para. 1033). Not the first time Microsoft has aroused these reactions, as I will mention further in this paper.

942,"December 20, 2015",Microsoft v. European Commission: Sounds Good In Theory But . . .,"
This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle
Robert O’Donoghue, Sep 20, 2007
Few cases in the annals of antitrust law have provoked as much reaction and interest as the various Microsoft proceedings, which have now continued in the United States (U.S.), the European Union (EU), and elsewhere for over a decade. Reasons for the inordinate level of interest are fairly obvious. First, Microsoft itself, as a company, has long incited strong opinions and passions. Proceedings outside the United States also had the added feature that Microsoft is a company of U.S. origin, prompting trade protection accusations. Second, the affected technology markets are complex, and of obvious major importance to producers and consumers alike, given the ubiquity of personal computers (PCs) and related software. Enforcement agencies continue to struggle to develop clear standards, as well as consistent, useful enforcement action with respect to technology markets. Finally, the principal legal issues in the various Microsoft proceedings “the extent to which a single firm can be compelled to deal with third parties and the limits on its ability to bundle separate products” are arguably the most controversial issues in antitrust law at the moment.
Not surprisingly, therefore, the Court of First Instance (CFI) judgment in the appeal against the 2004 Commission decision fining Microsoft almost 500 million for unlawful refusal to deal and bundling practices was eagerly anticipated. However, the CFI ruling will probably do very little to quell the controversies alluded to above.

Microsoft has struck a deal with a Chinese technology company to sell its new Windows 10 operating system to the country’s civil service, the company said late on Wednesday.
The new joint venture, which is subject to regulatory approval in China and is provisionally called C&M Information Technologies, will see Microsoft and its partner China Electronics Technology Group, license, deploy, manage and optimize Windows 10 for China’s government agencies and state owned enterprises. The joint venture will provide support and services for the customers.
The move comes as Microsoft looks to improve its image in the world’s second-largest economy. U.S. companies in China received a bad reputation after National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden alleged that foreign products were being used for spying. And last year, China’s antitrust regulator conducted new raids on Microsoft’s offices in China.

The Commission’s ‘Next Big Thing’?: Why the Google Case is Not ‘Microsoft Reloaded’ Torsten Koerber (Georg-August-Universität)
Abstract: On April 15, 2015 the European Commission sent Google its statement of objections (SO) in the Google Search case with regard to Google Shopping.
On the same day, it opened investigations against Google with regard to Android. The question of whether the contractual framework of Android licensing violates competition law has been covered in another SSRN article (it does not).
The following article is aimed at assessing the Commission’s competitive analysis and comparing the Google search case to other EU decisions, in particular to the European Commission’s decisions in the Microsoft cases. This is not an easy task because neither the SO nor Google’s response of August 27, 2015 have yet been published in full.
The following remarks, therefore, only reflect preliminary thoughts about the sparse information that has been revealed to the public in the Commission’s press releases and Google’s blogs. Based upon this information, the Commission does not seem to have a particularly strong case against Google.

Microsoft filed another suit against the US Internal Revenue Service, seeking information about the tax agency’s decision to hire outside lawyers, including one-time Microsoft nemesis David Boies, to help conduct an audit of the company. David Boies is the lawyer who beat Microsoft in an antitrust case in 2000.
The lawsuit, which was filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, seeks information from the IRS about contracts it made with two high-powered law firms to investigate Microsoft. What sparked the case are a pair of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests the company made regarding deals with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP and Boies Schiller & Flexner, LLP.
The extensive audit by the IRS stems over how tax is calculated for income made by Microsoft overseas, including its transfer prices to local affiliates in Bermuda and Puerto Rico. Retaining profits abroad is a common practice that can lower a U.S.-based company’s tax burden.
According to the complaint, Boies Schiller was awarded a $350,000 contract in 2013 to provide legal services to the IRS in connection with its audit of Microsoft. David Boies, the firm’s chairman, who’s known for his role as the lead prosecutor in the U.S. Justice Department’s antitrust suit against Microsoft, was named as lead counsel in the contract.

On Tuesday Google asked an Australian court to stay Epic Games’ claims that it is abusing its control over the Android operating system to harm competition for payments, reported Global Competition Review.
Earlier this year Epic Games announced that it has filed a legal claim against Google with the Federal Court of Australia, continuing its pursuit for fairer digital platforms globally. Epic has already filed a claim with the Court against Apple on similar grounds. 
In the claim Epic alleges that Google’s anti-competitive conduct breaches the Australian Consumer Law as well as various sections of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth). The company states that Google abuses its control over the Android operating system (“Android OS”), restricting competition in payment processing and app distribution on the Google Play Store. This harmful conduct stifles innovation, reduces consumer choice and inflates prices. 
This claim complements legal proceedings already underway in the US and UK, as well as an antitrust complaint against Apple in the European Union. Epic is not seeking damages from Google or Apple, it is simply seeking fair access and competition that will benefit consumers and developers. 
In addition to Epic’s claims in Australia against Apple and Google, the company is also participating in the Australian competition regulator’s review of mobile app marketplaces.

952,"October 13, 2021",Google Files Countersuit Saying Epic Games Breached Its Contract,"


Google filed a countersuit against Epic Games in their antitrust case in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, charging the game developer with breaching its contract with the tech giant, according to a TechCrunch report Wednesday, October 13.
Google’s countersuit argues that Google’s OS is a “critical source of competition against other operating systems,” noting that Android app users aren’t required to use Google Play.
Epic Games, the action noted, initially distributed the Android version of Fortnite on the Samsung Galaxy Store and its own website in 2018, before launching on Google Play in April 2020.
Related: Epic Files New Complaint In Google Suit
Google’s countersuit also denies many of Epic Games’ allegations in its own lawsuit, including Epic promoting its own payment system, the action that led to Epic’s legal entanglement with both Apple and Google.
“On August 13, 2020, Epic breached the Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement between Epic and Google dated June 12, 2020, by allowing Fortnite users who downloaded the app through Google Play to use Epic’s own payment processing tool instead of Google Play Billing,” the suit reads.
“Google further avers that for Fortnite transactions processed through Epic’s own payment processing tool, Google is paid nothing for its intellectual property or for app distribution,” according to the lawsuit. “Epic has reaped economic benefit from its relationship with Google and all of the services that Google provided to Epic.”
Google claims that Epic’s contract breach led to it removing Fortnite from the Google Play store last year.
Epic Games’ launch of Fortnite on Google Play was part of Project Liberty, according to Google, and it was part of Epic’s plan to end what it considers an anti-competitive fee from Apple and Google’s app stores. Google claims that Epic intentionally breached its contract to “draw Google into a legal battle over antitrust.”
Google asked for a jury trial in its countersuit and asks for compensatory and punitive damages, and restitution of Epic’s profits. Epic filed its complaint against Google in August 2020, claiming the Google Play store prevents healthy competition.

953,"October 7, 2021",Alternative Search Engines Write EU With Complaints About Google,"


Four search providers—DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, Qwant, and Lilo—have penned an open letter to the European Commission claiming that Google is suppressing search engine competition.
The EU has made a number of efforts to counter Google’s search monopoly, including a July 2018 ruling that the company engaged in “illegal tying of Google’s search and browser apps” and “illegal payments conditional on exclusive pre-installation of Google Search.”
Google responded with some licensing changes. In August 2019, it agreed with the EU to provide an Android Choice screen, which included selling spots on the new menu via auction – leading to participants like privacy-centric DuckDuckGo complaining that they were priced out.
The Android Choice screen has since been revised by further agreement with the European Commission, and now features more options and free participation. The new choice screen includes up to 12 search services, with the five most popular search engines in the local country listed first, as recorded by StatCounter, and is free for search providers.
Third-party search providers are not happy. Today’s open letter [PDF] states that “despite recent changes, we do not believe it will move market share significantly.” The providers say that the new Android Choice menu is “only shown once, in a Google-designed, Google-owned onboarding process. If [users] later decide to switch defaults, they must labour through 15+ clicks or factory-reset their phone.” They also complain that Chrome desktop and other operating systems are not included, and worry that “it doesn’t apply to all search aspects points in Android.”

Google’s Nest Hub doesn’t infringe a patent owned by Profectus Technology for a digital picture frame, a federal jury in Waco, Texas, found. The jury also sided with Google and found the patent claims invalid. 
The jury in US District Judge Alan Albright’s court, which is known as a hotspot for patent litigation, also found that the relevant parts of it weren’t valid.
Google’s attorney Darin Snyder of O’Melveny & Myers declined to comment. Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Profectus attorneys Casey Griffith and Michael Barbee of Griffith Barbee.
Texas-based Profectus sued Google last year, alleging its Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max – which control smart-home functions, display pictures and play music, among other things – infringe its patent. Profectus’ patent relates to a mountable picture frame for displaying digital images.
The jury found Wednesday after a four-day trial that Mountain View, California-based Google didn’t infringe the patent or induce others to infringe, and also found the five parts of the patent at issue weren’t patentable.

On Monday Google submitted a  motion to compel where they asked the District of Columbia court overseeing a Department of Justice antitrust suit to compel the production of documents from proposed custodian Luther Lowe, Yelp’s Senior Vice President of Public Policy. According to the defendant, the documents Lowe holds are crucial to its defense. The motion explained that Yelp’s long-held views about Google’s alleged monopolism were “conceived and advanced” by Lowe and reportedly are central to the government’s theory of liability.

The case, filed by the federal government and a handful of states, is proceeding through discovery after Google answered the complaint in December 2020. In the complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that Google acted as a “monopoly gatekeeper” and successfully acquired and maintained monopoly power in several markets: the general search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising markets.
The lawsuit seeks injunctive relief to restrain Google from its allegedly anticompetitive conduct. This week’s motion explains that Lowe is “a non-lawyer who has testified before the US Senate and Ohio Senate, has made numerous appearances on television and podcasts, and has given other commentary seeking antitrust enforcement against Google on the very allegations ultimately brought by the Plaintiffs.” As such, Google alleges that there is no comparable custodian.

956,"October 3, 2021",“Consumers Aren’t Stupid” Google Tells EU,"


Billions of people use Google because it’s the best, not because of deals the company made to stay competitive, Google’s lawyer said on Friday, wrapping up a week of testimony as the US tech giant fights a record US$5 billion antitrust fine. 
The European Commission hit Google with a €4.34 billion (US$5 billion) fine in 2018 for using its Android mobile operating system to thwart rivals and cement its dominance in general internet searching from 2011.
At issue are deals requiring phone makers to pre-install the Google Search app and the Chrome browser app together with Google Play, as well deals blocking some variants of Android.

“The reason why billions of people choose Google as their search tool every day is not because of an abuse of dominance. It’s because it’s the best,” lawyer Meredith Pickford told the EU’s General Court, the bloc’s second highest.
Pickford said the deals were far from being anti-competitive tools, rather they were to ensure Google stayed competitive.
“You can still compete hard and compete on the merits. Consumers aren’t stupid. If Bing or another search engine were better than Google, people would turn to it,” he said, referring to a rival Microsoft  search engine.

957,"September 30, 2021",Google Tells EU Court $5B Antitrust Fine Is Flawed,"


According to Reuters, €4.34 billion (US$5 billion) European Union antitrust fine was based on flawed calculations, Alphabet’s Google claimed on Thursday, September 30, urging Europe’s second-highest court to scrap or reduce what it claimed was not an appropriate penalty.
Google was fined for using its Android mobile operating system to thwart rivals and cement its dominance in general internet search from 2011, in the largest penalty meted out to any company found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules.
“The fine that was imposed, a staggering 4.34 billion euros, was not appropriate,” Google’s lawyer Genevra Forwood told the five-judge panel of the General Court on the fourth day of a week-long hearing, which is taking place three years after the European Commission sanctioned the company.
Related: Google Tells EU Court New Updates Give Android A Chance Against Apple
“The problem is not the headline-grabbing fine per se. The problem is how the Commission reached that figure,” she said.
Forwood said there was no anti-competitive intent in Google’s actions nor could it have known that its conduct was an abuse based on EU case law and there was no precedent for it.
“So it was wrong for the Commission to impose any fine at all, let alone turn up the dials to reach its biggest fine ever,” Forwood said.
She also took issue with the EU competition enforcer adding a 11% gravity factor to Google’s fine, compared with 5% for Intel in 2009 in a separate case.
“Even if this Court considers that a fine is appropriate, it would only be proper to turn the dials right down,” she said.

958,"September 29, 2021",Google Tells EU Court New Updates Give Android A Chance Against Apple,"


Payments to phone makers to pre-install only Google Search on their devices were not aimed at preventing competition, but were necessary for Android to seize market share from Apple, Alphabet’s Google told Europe’s second-top court on Wednesday, September 29.
Google was addressing the General Court on the third day of a week-long hearing as it tries to get judges to dismiss a record €4.3 billion (US$3.7 billion) EU antitrust fine and a European Commission order to loosen its search engine grip on Android devices.
The EU competition watchdog had taken issue with two kinds of deals made with phone makers, one being payments for only pre-installing Google Search on their devices known as revenue sharing arrangements (RSAs) because these shut out rivals.
This was not the case and the payments were just to encourage phone makers, which were already generating money from other apps, to give Android a place, Google lawyer Assimakis Komninos told the court.
“Google had to offer an offsetting revenue stream. An incentive to convince them to open up and adopt the Android platform. At the same time, the RSAs also helped them to keep prices down and compete more successfully with Apple,” he said.
“And obviously, Google was getting in return a promotional opportunity, sole preinstallation, which allowed it to invest in a free OS (operating system), a free app store and so on.”
On top of that, the RSAs only covered 5% of the market, Komninos said.
Commission lawyer Nicholas Khan rejected the claim. “What concerned them was competitors gaining traction,” he said and the RDAs were “the pinnacle of Google’s interlocking practices.”

Google is on a collision course with advertisers and publishers who fired off a fresh antitrust complaint with the European Union in the run up to the US tech giant’s court fight over a record US$5 billion antitrust fine.  
Movement for an Open Web, an industry group, asked the European Union to rein in how Google tweaks its search engine, after the company imposed ad-tracking changes that threaten to hit advertisers’ and publishers’ revenue streams.  
A previous complaint fueled a UK probe and the group’s members now want their evidence to bolster the European Commission’s wide-ranging investigation into Google’s advertising technology. 
Google, a unit of Alphabet, has been embroiled in various antitrust battles in Europe for more than a decade. Its lawyers are currently challenging a record US$5 billion EU fine at a five-day court hearing in Luxembourg. The EU earlier this year stated it would investigate Google’s privacy changes and how the search giant may favor its own online display advertising technologies over rivals.

Amazon is suing EU antitrust regulators for allowing the Italian competition watchdog to pursue its own case against the US online retail giant over the way it selects sellers, arguing that this should be wrapped into an EU investigation, reported Bloomberg.
Amazon took its case to the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe’s second-highest, on Tuesday, January 19, asking it to annul the EU’s decision to exclude Italy from the wider investigation, a court filing shows.
The move came two months after the European Commission opened an investigation into the criteria the company uses to select winners of its “buy box,” which allows customers to add items from a specific retailer directly into their shopping carts.
The probe will also examine whether the company gives preferential treatment to its own retail offers and marketplace sellers that use its logistics and delivery services.
The Italian case was launched in 2019 over the same issue but focuses on the Italian logistics markets. Amazon said the EU should absorb the Italian case for the sake of consistency and efficiency.
“When the European Commission decides to investigate a matter, European law says that national competition authorities cannot investigate the same topic. This did not occur in this instance, as the Commission’s opening decision attempts to exclude Italy,” Amazon said in a statement.

By Marianela Lopez-Galdos, Project Disco 
As antitrust continues to gain momentum in relation to the tech sector, lawyers seem to increasingly think that the antitrust laws can be used to solve commercial disputes that pertain to other areas of law, such as contract law. 
As you may have heard, Amazon Web Services (AWS), a cloud service provider owned by Amazon, decided to suspend controversial social media company Parler following the deadly riots that happened in the Capitol.  Parler is a social media company that competes with Twitter and Facebook, and that has recently gained popularity among conservatives.  AWS decided to suspend Parler’s use of its service after the company repeatedly refused to moderate or remove content that explicitly called for violence, in violation of AWS’s Terms of Service.  As a result of this and Parler’s decisions both before and after the incident, the site is not currently available on the Internet.¹  
Against this contractual dispute, Parler filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.  In an act of wild speculation, Parler alleges Amazon colluded with Twitter (a company not named as a party) to suspend Parlerfrom AWS for political reasons, and asks the federal judge in Seattle to issue a temporary restraining order restoring Parler’s service. Amazon’s response to the lawsuit can be found here.

969,"December 3, 2020","Arbitration Over Competition – The Strange Case of Amazon, Reliance, and Future Retail","
By Subhomoy Bhattacharjee1
 
Strangely while the battle between Reliance Industries (“RIL”) and Amazon India (“Amazon”) for market share in the business-to-business segment of the Indian retail market should be fit for the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”) to decide, it has transmogrified into an arbitration battle instead.
When it comes to adjudicating competition in the Indian retail business, forums other than the competition regulator seem to take center stage. Amazon had earlier lost the business-to-consumer market due to the FDI policy prohibiting an inventory-based e-commerce model for foreign corporations.2 Now the acquisition of Future group’s retail business by Reliance has been challenged by Amazon by virtue of the latter’s holding rights in Future group. In the process it could drag the Government of India into the fray. Yet it is prima facie a struggle to decide who gains primacy in the Indian retail market estimated to reach $1.6 trillion by 2025 and especially its fastest growing segment, that of online business, currently at less than 10 percent of the market.3
On Friday, November 20, the Competition Commission of India tweeted it has approved the takeover of Future Group by two RIL entities.4 Yet this approval means relatively nothing to the stakes between India’s largest company by market capitalization and Amazon. The regulator’s subsequent press note said its detailed order will follow soon.5
 
A Competition Issue but not with CCI:
In January 2019, Amazon had invested a 49 percent share in Future Group company, named Future Coupons for Rs 1,431 crore. As part of the agreement, Amazon had been granted a call option. This option allows Amazon to acquire all or part of the promoters’ shareholding in Future Retail and can be exercised in three or ten years. So, in August this year, when RIL’s two entities bought for Rs 25,000 crore six companies, namely Future Retail, Future Lifestyle Fashions, Future Consumer, Future Supply Chains and Future Market Networks in a slump sale, all of which will be merged into one company, Future Enterprises Limited (“FEL”), Amazon had challenged it. It has argued the sale has denied it the Rights of First Refusal for the deal with Future Group.
Yet Amazon has not challenged the RIL/Future deal in the competition regulator’s court, it has decided to challenge it as an arbitration issue. The competition question is therefore left simmering. The Competition Commission of India’s press release has ruled that RIL entities Reliance Retail Ventures Limited and Reliance Retail and Fashion Lifestyle Limited have its permission to acquire the retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing businesses of Future Group. The RIL entities, in their notice to the Commission for approving the acquisition, had clearly stated the market where the combined entity shall operate is the one for business-to-business sales in India. It is the same market where Amazon also has got the license to operate. The stakes are massive as the B2B segment is reckoned to be six times bigger than the consumer facing retail stores business within the overall retail pie.6 “I suspect the regulator has differentiated between the brick and mortar market and the online market to draw its conclusion that there shall be no dominance by the RIL-Future Group deals,” said Mandar Kagade, Principal, Black Dot Public Policy Advisors.
In September, the Commission had cleared Amazon of charges of alleged abuse of dominance brought on behalf of apparel company Beverly Hills and Polo Club, which could be the reason the company has not tried to block the RIL deal there.7 The CCI order had noted both Amazon and Flipkart have a market share of around 35 percent each in this market so there is no abuse of dominance. But at the same time, the competition regulator has launched an investigation against the Jeff Bezos owned company for an antitrust claim brought by more than one Indian sellers’ organizations. Each of them has made similar charges. They allege Amazon offers preferential treatment to some sellers as well as indulges in predatory pricing. The Karnataka High Court has stayed the regulator’s hands but then again, the Supreme Court in late October has asked for the stay to be decided upon either way, within six weeks.
Clearly Amazon’s legal teams also feel they have more chance to block the deal through the arbitration courts. To what extent does this speak about the efficiency of the CCI is a debatable point. Amazon may have been able to argue (hypothetically) that there is a loss of competition in the economy against war RIL has claimed.
But to adjudicate better on the issue, the regulator possibly needed to examine the deal from the consumers point of view. In other words, has there been any welfare loss for the economy? But the Commission has not been often able to make this focus clear. It has instead chased market share as an evidence of anti-competitive behavior as it has done in the case of Google. Geeta Gouri, former member of the Commission says the regulator must decide from the principle of what benefits the consumer the most. “The Commission frames the questions from the point of view of market share but the centrality of the interest of the consumer is often missed. Mainly because they do not define who is the consumer.”
 
Implications for the Government of India
The battle has therefore moved on to a challenge in arbitration forums. This has implications for the government of India and will therefore not go down just as a commercial battle between the domestic and foreign retail giants. It is because of India’s uncomfortable position vis a vis such awards handed out by foreign courts. This has happened twice this year. In September, Vodafone International Holdings won an arbitration award at The Hague arbitration center against the Indian government against a retrospective taxation demand. Now, Amazon has secured an interim order from the Singapore International Arbitration Centre to block the deal between Future Retail and RIL entity Reliance Retail Ventures. Amazon has claimed it was denied the Rights of First Refusal for the deal with Future Group.
At first blush, these do not seem to offer any common ground. The Vodafone award challenged a government’s tax policy, the Amazon-RIL case is a commercial dispute. Yet it turns out, there are massive similarities.
New Delhi operates under its domestic Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1995, which it has subsequently revised in 2015 and then last year. While India aspires to become an international arbitration venue it has not been able to reconcile the domestic act with the global architecture of arbitration under the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) convention to which more than 150 countries are signatories.
India is instead a member of the softer UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) convention on arbitration or what is known as the New York Convention. Here too, India has signed on with caveats. The most important of those is that arbitration awards will only apply where the disputes are plainly considered as commercial under domestic law and does not challenge India’s “public policy.” For instance, India does not recognize the relationship between tax department and assesses as a commercial relation. Courts in India have also upheld this logic though of late, the Supreme Court has tried to soften this logic.8
As a result, companies have found this an excellent loophole to exploit. Even Bibek Debroy, the chairman of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council and who has often advised the government on clearing India’s legal mess, has noted this problem. “Challenging arbitral awards on grounds of public policy has become an Achilles heel for arbitration in India: a means by which losing parties can attack arbitral awards, on much broader grounds than are permitted in other countries”.9 His observation comes in a paper he coauthored for Niti Aayog to help build India’s credentials as an arbitration center.10 He also points to other problems, chief among them being the lack of clarity of the financial model on which such a centre shall operate and whether there should be one or more spread across the country.
Future Group has used this cover of public policy to buttress its proposed Rs 27,000 crore deal with the RIL entity. The brick and mortar retail group has argued in the Delhi High Court that the interim order by the Emergency Arbitration, constituted under the SIAC Rules, was passed without jurisdiction. The key word the company has used is that the award is alien to India’s Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1995. Whereas armed with the order from Singapore Amazon has also brought in the market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Bombay Stock Exchange asking them to consider the interim order before they approve the deal between Future Retail and Reliance Retail Ventures.11
Amazon has been rather astute in getting a Singapore arbitration award. The island nation is the only one with whom India has a mutually recognized arbitration route. It was signed as part of the India Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement in 2005. It also helped that both the Future Group and Amazon had written in the role of Singapore as the seat to resolve any dispute. But under the way arbitration game occurs across countries, it was open for Amazon to have approached any other arbitration forums too, like those in The Hague, London, or Paris.
The single judge bench of the Delhi High Court shall soon give its judgment on the dispute. Any recognition of the emergency arbitration by the bench could end up deciding if Vodafone International, among others can claim its victory in an off-shore arbitration award shall also be recognized in India. Gouri says the questions thrown up by the arbitration case are salient to decide what sort of money India gets from the world markets.
Either way this could be one of the most profound judgments with cascading impact on India’s treatment of foreign investors. Because of India’s iffy legal treatment of foreign inflow most portfolio investors prefer Singapore as the seat from where to invest into India. Any move by the government to retract any aspect of this arrangement has been resisted by them. This year itself finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had to change the tax laws to recognize that FPIs organized as trusts will pay only 15 percent tax on their dividend income against a proposed 25 to 37 percent range. Domestic investment trusts do not get this advantage. The walk back happened this year when government could use any additional money. It is the price India pays for keeping its arbitration laws disconnected from global best practices. How RIL-Amazon dispute shapes up could therefore be of far more significance than it already is.

970,"December 10, 2020",Germany Probes Linkage Between Oculus & Facebook,"


The Bundeskartellamt initiated abuse proceedings against Facebook to examine the linkage between Oculus virtual reality products and Facebook.
Andreas Mundt, President of the Bundeskartellamt said in a statement, “In the future, the use of the newOculus glasses requires the user to also have a Facebook account. Linking virtual reality products and the group’s social network in this way could constitute a prohibited abuse of dominance by Facebook. With its social network Facebook holds a dominant position in Germany and is also already an important player in the emerging but growing VR (virtual reality) market. We intend to examine whether and to what extent this tying arrangement will affect competition in both areas of activity.”
Facebook has begun to integrate its virtual reality activities into the social network Facebook.com. The Oculus platform, which has previously been operated separately from Facebook.com, will be offered as an additional function on Facebook’s social network, under the name “Facebook Reality Labs”. The use of the latest “Quest 2” VRglasses, will require registration using a Facebook.com account. Existing Oculus accounts can no longer be used for registration and the new hardware. Distribution of the new VR glasses outside Germany has already begun.

971,"December 10, 2020",Facebook Antitrust Suits Have Bipartisan Support,"


Democrats and Republicans have joined together to support antitrust charges leveled against Facebook Wednesday, December 9, by the Federal Trade Commission and an alliance of attorneys general from 48 states, a move that seeks to break up the company and reverse previously approved acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (Independent – Vermont) applauded the effort, writing on Twitter that Facebook’s “greed knows no bounds, and they’ve used their power to try and control too much of political and economic life all over the world… the only thing that will stop Facebook is to say ‘enough is enough’ and break it up.” 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Democrat – New York) concurred, describing the social media giant as “an out-of-control monopoly” that has “abused its market power to squash competition, manipulate democracies, and crush journalism.”
Colorado Republican Ken Buck, a member of the House judiciary committee, said that Facebook “crushed the competition by breaking the law” and wrote on Twitter that “Big Tech’s reckoning has just begun.”

972,"December 9, 2020",FTC & 46 States Hit Facebook With Antitrust Suits,"


The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and more than 40 states accused Facebook on Wednesday, December 9, of becoming a social media monopoly by buying up its rivals to illegally kill competition, reported Bloomberg.
Federal and state regulators, which have been investigating the company for over 18 months, stated in separate lawsuits that Facebook’s purchases, especially Instagram for US$1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for US$19 billion two years later, eliminated competition that could have one day challenged the company’s dominance.
The FTC’s case is its most ambitious in recent memory and it seeks to unwind Facebook’s prior acquisitions of the photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging service WhatsApp, reported the Wall Street Journal. It comes just weeks after the Justice Department brought an antitrust lawsuit targeting Google’s flagship search engine business. Each federal agency now has its own once-in-a-generation case at the same time, a signal of the level of US concern about the power of dominant online platforms.
The suits come roughly 14 months after New York Attorney General Letitia James announced that her office was leading a group of attorneys general in investigating Facebook for potential anticompetitive practices. More than 40 attorneys general ultimately signed onto Wednesday’s complaint. The FTC, meanwhile, has been conducting its own antitrust investigation of Facebook since June 2019.
“For nearly a decade, Facebook has used its dominance and monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuff out competition, all at the expense of everyday users,” said Attorney General Letitia James of New York, who led the multistate investigation into the company’s in parallel with the federal agency.
The lawsuits, filed in the US District Court of the District of Columbia, underscore the growing bipartisan and international tsunami against Big Tech. Lawmakers and regulators have zeroed in on the grip that Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple maintain on commerce, electronics, social networking, search and online advertising, remaking the nation’s economy. President Trump has argued repeatedly that the tech giants have too much power and influence, and allies of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. have made similar complaints.

973,"December 8, 2020",UK Watchdog Proposes Tailored Antitrust Rules For Google & Facebook,"


Britain’s competition watchdog stated that tailored rules should be used to regulate tech giants Google, Facebook, and others on Tuesday, December 8, reported Reuters.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated that a legally binding code of conduct backed up by penalties that could extend to fines of up to 10% of turnover, as well as enhanced merger rules, should be set up in legislation.
The code will be enforced by a new Digital Markets Unit announced last month.
CMA Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said consumers and businesses who relied on Google and Facebook should be treated fairly, with a level playing field for competitors.
“For that to happen, the UK needs new powers and a new approach,” he said on Tuesday. “In short, we need a modern regulatory regime that can enable innovation to thrive, while taking swift action to prevent problems.”
The CMA’s proposals are based on principles rather than rules or outcomes, tailored to different technologies, reported Reuters. 
The proposed rules focus on companies’ dominance in individual sectors, such as Google and Facebook in digital advertising. The two companies accounted for around 80% of £14 billion (US$18.7 billion) spent in 2019, the CMA stated.

974,"December 7, 2020","Facebook Braces For Federal, State Antitrust Suits","


Federal and state antitrust regulators could file lawsuits against Facebook very soon, Bloomberg reported on Monday, December 7, citing sources.
The social media giant could be accused of stifling rivals by taking advantage of its own powerful position, the sources said, per Bloomberg.
Lawsuits could be filed this week on behalf of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and a group of state attorneys general led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, according to the sources. The sources further told Bloomberg that on the state level, new lawsuits are being planned against Google and could be filed in the coming weeks.
The Google case will be up to President-elect Joe Biden’s administration to advance. The Facebook case will be handled by the next FTC chairman, unless the present chair Joe Simons, appointed by Trump, stays on with the agency, according to the Bloomberg report.
The upcoming lawsuits are expected to target Facebook’s reported antitrust violations. Two of the main complaints were from startup investors, privacy activists and antitrust experts following Facebook’s 2012 acquisition of Instagram for US$1 billion, and its 2014 acquisition of WhatsApp for US$22 billion. Simons has said antitrust enforcers should watch for bigger firms acquiring emerging startups in their same fields.

975,"December 6, 2020",Facebook’s Antitrust Probe To Focus On Handling Of Oculus VR Division,"


Virtual-reality startups are accusing Facebook of using a familiar playbook to muscle out rivals in what could be the digital platform of the future, prompting a new line of scrutiny from US competition enforcers, reported CNET.
Facebook is the world’s biggest virtual-reality hardware maker thanks to its 2014 acquisition of Oculus for US$2 billion. Its practices are now drawing the attention of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, which is talking to developers about their interactions with the company, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The scrutiny over Facebook’s virtual-reality business reflects broader concerns that the social-media pioneer has grown too powerful. One US lawmaker, during a hearing with Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, attributed the company’s dominance to a simple strategy: Copy, acquire, and kill any company that’s a competitive threat.
Software developers and startup founders say the world’s biggest social media company is now using that same playbook to undermine competition in the virtual-reality market.

A group of US states led by New York is investigating Facebook for possible antitrust violations and plans to file a lawsuit against the social media giant next week, reported Reuters.
The latest point of contention over antitrust issues comes after comments from Joe Simons, chair of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) last month. Simons said antitrust enforcers should be on guard against dominant companies buying emerging startups.
“A monopolist can squash a nascent competitor by buying it, not just by targeting it with anti-competitive actions,” Simons said. “It may be easier and more effective to buy the nascent threat, only if to keep it out of the hands of others.”
Bloomberg reported Thursday, December 3, that virtual reality startups are accusing Facebook of muscling out the competition in that up-and-coming technology. Facebook is accused of using its market power to keep out companies that offer competing games and services.
The social media giant is also the world’s biggest virtual reality hardware maker, due to its 2014 acquisition of Oculus for US$2 billion. Its practices are drawing the attention of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, Bloomberg reported.

978,"December 1, 2020","Is That Really Necessary? Facebook, RFI, and the General Court","
By: Björn Herbers (D’Kart)
Facebook, excessive data collection, antitrust law… I know what you’re thinking and you’re right: data is the new oil, if there is anything that can tame the Tech Giants it is antitrust law. Facebook dominates the market for social networks and the Federal Court of Justice has no serious doubts that Facebook’s data collection is abusive. So what’s new, you ask? The two cases (T-451/20 and T-452/20) brought before the General Court in July and on which the court in Luxembourg has now decided on interim relief, are about something else and that is only marginally to do with the combined data power of “GAFA”. Facebook, for its part, accuses the European Commission’s competition authorities of going too far in collecting data and not holding back even with sensitive personal information. The Commission as the true data-hungry monster, not GAFA – “man bites dog”, as it were? In any case, the General Court in its decisions of 29 October, ordered the Commission to set up a data room and arrange specific protective measures for certain data that Facebook must provide. At the same time, there were very critical comments on the Commission’s practice with regard to requests for information and the Court’s order suggests (very) strongly that companies’ rights of defence against “fishing expeditions” and the uncontrolled handling of their data must be boosted.
That sounds interesting, but can we start at the beginning?
With pleasure. As you know, the Commission has been investigating Facebook in two cases since last year: in the first case (AT.40628 – “Facebook Data-related practices”), the Commission is investigating whether the collection, processing, use and monetisation of data by Facebook is in line with EU competition law. One of the suspicions is that the social network uses its data trove to identify and squash potential rivals. In the second case (AT.40684 – “Facebook Marketplace”), the Directorate General for Competition is investigating whether Facebook – by linking social networks and Facebook Marketplace, where users can offer and sell items for free – could be abusing a dominant position and unfairly hindering other providers of virtual flea markets.
Strong stuff, but Facebook is at pains to stress that antitrust compliance is a core consideration in the way the company does business and that it is cooperating with the Commission to clear up the allegations: “We stand ready to answer any questions the European Commission may have“. The Commission seems to have taken this promise very literally. After a series of requests for information to Facebook and other market participants and some back-and-forth about which information and documents Facebook should send to Brussels, Facebook received another letter from the Commission in early May. The Commission now adopted formal decisions requiring extensive internal documents from Facebook in both proceedings. According to Facebook’s antitrust team, the request concerned hundreds of thousands of documents. The sheer number of documents is due to the Commission’s request for submission of all documents available on Facebook’s IT systems containing certain search terms and that these search terms were of a very general nature, such as “advantage”, “quality” or even “looked at”. Facebook claims that, while it would of course still like to cooperate with the Commission, “the exceptionally broad nature of the Commission’s requests means we would be required to turn over predominantly irrelevant documents that have nothing to do with the Commission’s investigations.” At the same time – and here Facebook had particular reservations – a lot of sensitive information from Facebook employees or the company itself would get caught in the net of this broad Commission request. Documents containing employees’ medical information, personal financial documents and private information about employees’ families or internal security precautions documents would show up using the proposed search terms. Hence, Facebook’s response to the Commission: Sorry, but no can do. Instead, Facebook’s external lawyers could filter out from the documents requested those that are obviously irrelevant to the investigation and/or contain sensitive personal information. However, the Commission did not consider it the best idea to leave it to Facebook’s lawyers to decide which material its case handlers should be allowed to see…

Facebook is getting closer to finalizing an acquisition deal with the customer service chatbot startup Kustomer, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal citing sources.
The deal could close by the end of the day on Monday, November 30, and would value the New York-headquartered startup at more than US$1 billion, the sources said. Following a private funding round last year, Kustomer was valued at US$710 million. 
Founded in 2015 by Brad Birnbaum, chief executive officer, and Jeremy Suriel, chief technology officer, Kustomer is an omnichannel software-as-a-service (SaaS) and customer relationship management (CRM) firm that specializes in chatbot technology.
Shopify teamed up with Kustomer in July to advance more efficient operations. Kustomer said its platform will help retailers on Shopify automate 40% of interactions. The collaboration will also enable businesses to track all customer interactions.

980,"April 27, 2021",Apple To Face EU Antitrust Charges Over Spotify Complaint This Week,"
The European Commission will issue antitrust charges against Apple over concerns about the company’s App Store practices, according to a report from the Financial Times. The Commission has been investigating whether Apple has broken EU competition rules with its App Store policies, following an initial complaint from Spotify back in 2019 over Apple’s 30% cut on subscriptions.
The European Commission opened up two antitrust investigations into Apple’s App Store and Apple Pay practices last year, and the Financial Times only mentions upcoming charges on the App Store case. It’s not clear yet what action will be taken. 
Spotify has previously claimed Apple uses its App Store to stifle innovation and limit consumer choice in favor of its own Apple Music service. Rakuten filed a similar complaint to the EU last year, alleging that it’s anti-competitive for Apple to take a 30% commission on ebooks sold through the App Store while promoting its own Apple Books service.
Known as the “Apple tax,” this 30% cut has long been targeted by companies like Netflix and Spotify. Apple has defended its policies, arguing that the revenue it earns contributes toward the costs of maintaining the App Store and enforcing its content, privacy, and security guidelines.
Epic Games also filed an antitrust complaint with the EU earlier this year, as part of its ongoing dispute with Apple. The Fortnite developer has publicly criticized Apple’s App Store policies around distribution and payments, resulting in Epic attempting to circumventApple’s 30% cut on in-app purchases in Fortnite. Apple quickly removed the game from its App Store, and a legal battle is now in progress.

981,"April 26, 2021",Germany Hits Apple With Antitrust Complaint Over New iPhone Software,"
Apple has been accused of antitrust abuse in Germany as it prepares to roll out a new version of its iPhone software. A complaint was filed to Bundeskartellamt, Germany’s competition regulator, on Monday, April 26. The news was first reported by The Financial Times and confirmed to CNBC by a Bundeskartellamt spokesperson.
Apple’s iOS 14.5 software will include a feature called ATT, or App Tracking Transparency. The feature will force app developers to ask users if they’re happy to be tracked for advertising purposes, and many iPhone owners are expected to say no.
Companies that rely on online advertising, especially Facebook, have claimed that the privacy change will reduce the effectiveness and profitability of targeted ads and potentially roil the online advertising business.
The complaint was filed by ZAW, the German Advertising Federation, on behalf of the nine industry associations that it represents. The association’s members include the likes of Facebook and media giant Axel Springer, which owns Insider and Bild.
ZAW argues in the complaint that Apple’s ATT feature abuses its market power and violates antitrust law.
“Through these unilaterally imposed measures, Apple effectively excludes all competitors from processing commercially relevant data in the Apple ecosystem,” ZAW stated in a press release. “At the same time, however, the group excludes its own (advertising) services from the planned changes and collects significant amounts of user data itself.”

982,"April 25, 2021",Apple Questioned On App Store Scammers In Antitrust Hearing,"


Apple was questioned on its inability to rein in subscription scammers on its App Store during’s Senate antitrust hearing, reported TechCrunch. The tech giant has argued that one of the reasons it requires developers to pay App Store commissions is to help Apple fight marketplace fraud and protect consumers. But developers claim Apple is doing very little to stop obvious scams that are now raking in millions and impacting consumer trust in the overall subscription economy, as well as in their own legitimate, subscription-based businesses.
One developer in particular, Kosta Eleftheriou, has made it his mission to highlight some of the most egregious scams on the App Store. Functioning as a one-man bunco squad, Eleftheriou regularly tweets out examples of apps that are leveraging fake reviews to promote their harmful businesses.
Some of the more notable scams he’s uncovered as of late include a crypto wallet app that scammed a user out of his life savings (~US$600,000) in bitcoin; a kids game that actually contained a hidden online casino; and a VPN app scamming users out of US$5 million per year. And, of course, there’s the scam that lit the fire in the first place: A competitor to Eleftheriou’s own Apple Watch app that he alleges scammed users out of US$2 million per year, after stealing his marketing materials, cloning his app, and buying fake reviews to make the scammer’s look like the better choice.
In a line of questioning from Georgia’s Senator Jon Ossoff, Apple’s Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer was asked why Apple was not able to locate scams, given that these fraudulent apps are, as Ossoff put it, “trivially easy to identify as scams.”
He asked why do we have rely upon “open-source reporting and journalists” to find the app scams — a reference that likely, at least in part, referred to Eleftheriou’s recent activities.

983,"April 21, 2021",App Makers Tell Congress “We’re all afraid” Of Google & Apple,"


Apple and Google faced a battery of accusations on Wednesday, April 21, from prominent app developers, including Spotify and Tile, who alleged that the large tech platforms have abused their dominance and harmed competition, reported CNBC.
“We’re all afraid,” Match Group Chief Legal Officer Jared Sine told Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Democrat – Minnessota) the chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, at a hearing.
In a lengthy Senate hearing, the app makers said Apple and Google’s rules surrounding in-app payments and app updates allow the tech giants to choke off rival services, and that they engage in retaliation when app developers refuse to comply.
The occasionally tense showdown highlighted how antitrust scrutiny of Apple is ramping up after more than a year of similar focus on its peers such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google. And lawmakers were clear that the hearing would serve as a springboard for legislation to rein in large tech platforms.
Much of the hearing zeroed in on Apple’s treatment of app makers, largely because of Apple’s closed ecosystem that prohibits the installation of iOS apps from anywhere but the Apple app store.
This week, Apple introduced a new product known as the AirTag, a small device that can be used to locate missing items. Tile, which makes a competing product, accused Apple of giving AirTag an unfair home-court advantage by not allowing Tile devices to use the same advanced, ultra-wideband frequencies to communicate with iPhones that AirTag uses.

984,"April 21, 2021",Apple & Google Testify On App Store Dominance,"


A panel of US Senators questioned officials from Apple and Alphabet’s Google on Wednesday, April 21, about the dominance of their mobile app stores and whether the companies abuse their power at the expense of smaller competitors, reported Reuters.
Amy Klobuchar, the top Senate Democrat on antitrust issues, said Apple and Google can use their power to “exclude or suppress apps that compete with their own products” and “charge excessive fees that affect competition.”
App makers like music streaming service Spotify and dating services giant Match, which owns the Tinder app, have long complained that mandatory revenue sharing for sales of digital goods and strict inclusion rules set by Apple’s App Store for iPhones and iPads, along with Google’s Play store for Android devices, amount to anticompetitive behavior.
Representatives for Apple and Google told senators that the companies’ tight control over their stores and the associated revenue-sharing requirements are needed to enforce and pay for security measures to protect consumers from harmful apps and practices.
But when asked by Senator Josh Hawley, Apple’s Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer would not commit to spending all of the mandatory fees on security.
Explanations from Andeer and Google’s Wilson White, senior director for government affairs, about why the companies’ fees do not apply to Uber and apps that sell physical goods also failed to satisfy senators.
“I feel like unfrozen caveman lawyer,” Senator Mike Lee said. “I’m not grasping it.”
Senator Richard Blumenthal expressed concern about a call Match stated it received late Tuesday from its business counterpart at Google.

986,"April 21, 2021",Apple’s New AirTags Could Add To Antitrust Scrutiny,"


Apple launched its long-anticipated AirTags on Tuesday, April 20, a quarter-sized tracking device that is a lightning rod for Apple’s critics and competitors who say the tech giant is abusing its power in the smartphone market, reported The Washington Post.
The US$29 gadget, Apple’s first new hardware product category in three years, is meant to help iPhone users find lost items. But it’s the type of device that smaller device-makers have been selling for years — and critics say Apple’s entry into the market will make it harder for competitors to operate.
By attaching an AirTag to an item like a purse or a keychain, anything can be located by one of the roughly 1 billion iPhones in the world. The AirTag’s signal can get pickup up by iPhones connected to Apple’s “Find My” network, a software service that launched in 2019 and helps Apple users find lost devices.
Tile, founded in 2012, offers four hardware devices that can be affixed to keychains, stuffed in wallets or stuck to bicycle saddles. Tile’s software is built into products like Bose headphones and Fitbit fitness trackers to offer a nearly identical localization service. But Tile says it’s at an inherent disadvantage to Apple, which can prioritize its own devices.
For instance, in order for Tile’s products to work properly on iOS, Apple’s mobile operating system, users must give Tile permission to track their location at all times, and Apple took away the ability of users to select that option when setting up the app for the first time. But all Apple customers are defaulted into tracking for the Find My network during the phone’s initial setup.
Apple spokesman Shane Bauer said, “We have always embraced competition as the best way to drive great experiences for our customers, and we have worked hard to build a platform in iOS that enables third-party developers to thrive.” Bauer added that Apple would have to sell a lot of AirTags to catch up with Tile and he said Apple hopes Tile will join the Find My network.

Google will send a top policy executive to testify at Wednesday, April 21’s Senate app store antitrust hearing, while legal executives from Spotify, Tile, and Match will serve as witnesses, according to Bloomberg.
Google Senior Director of Government Affairs and Public Policy Wilson White will be the search giant’s representative, joining Apple Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer in the spotlight. The Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust and Consumer Rights, which is holding the hearing, also plans to call Horacio Gutierrez, Kirsten Daru, and Jared Sine, top legal executives from Spotify, Tile, and Match Group, respectively.
Mark Cooper, director of research for the Consumer Federation of America, will also be called. Spotify, Tile, and Match have all been embroiled in antitrust fights with Apple recently, with Spotify and Match filing complaints about Apple’s App Store rules and fees. Tile believes Apple’s Find My app will give the company’s rumored AirTags accessory for finding physical objects a leg up over third-party rivals.
The Senate subcommittee is investigating Apple and Google over competition issues and concerns from app developers. Apple’s Andeer previously testified on several matters for Apple before the House of Representatives and other US lawmakers.
White, a top deputy of Google legal chief Kent Walker, joined the company in 2011 after working as a software developer and patent lawyer. Since 2013, he has worked as a policy director on Google’s ads and apps divisions, units that were critical to Google’s business success with mobile phones. They’re also units that have been at the center of some of Google’s political troubles.

988,"April 19, 2021",Apple To Let Parler Back On The App Store,"


Apple has approved Parler’s return to the iOS app store following improvements the social media company made to better detect and moderate hate speech and incitement, according to a letter the iPhone maker sent to Congress on Monday, April 19. 
The decision clears the way for Parler, an app popular with conservatives including some members of the far right, to be downloaded once again on Apple devices. The letter — addressed to Sen. Mike Lee and Rep. Ken Buck and obtained by CNN — explained that since the app was removed from Apple’s platform in January for violations of its policies, Parler “has proposed updates to its app and the app’s content moderation practices.” 
On April 14, Apple’s app review team told Parler that its proposed changes were sufficient, the letter continued. Now, all Parler needs to do is to flip the switch. “Apple anticipates that the updated Parler app will become available immediately upon Parler releasing it,” Apple’s letter read. 
Parler, an alternative to Facebook and Twitter that bills itself as a haven for free speech, was removed from major tech platforms in early January following the US Capitol riots of January 6. Parler was kicked off of Apple and Google’s app stores, as well as Amazon Web Services, which had been hosting the company’s product. 
All three tech giants cited the presence of violent speech on Parler as a reason for removal; Parler later stated that other vendors also cut ties with the company, effectively shutting the service down and making it inaccessible on the web. For several weeks, visitors to Parler’s website were greeted by a static page instead of a functioning social networking app.

Tras varios meses de negociaciones, Yahoo! y Microsoft anunciaron el pasado jueves que han reestructurado su alianza en el mercado de buscadores, buscando aumentar la flexibilidad en la presentación de sus resultados de búsqueda, así como mejorando la coordinación entre sus equipos de publicidad.
La reestructuración se completó poco después que Microsoft incrementara sus pagos a Yahoo!, revitalizando un acuerdo alcanzado en 2009.
El nuevo acuerdo le otorga mayor flexibilidad a Yahoo! en la presentación de búsquedas en dispositivos móviles y computadoras. Yahoo! continuará ofreciendo espacios publicitarios y resultados obtenidos por Bing, el buscador de Microsoft, en una gran mayoría de sus búsquedas. Los provistos económicos del acuerdo no han sido modificados.

After months of negotiations, Yahoo and Microsoft announced on Thursday that they’ve restructured their landmark search alliance to give greater flexibility in how search results are presented and how their ad teams work.
The restructured deal comes as Microsoft has upped its payment to Yahoo under the agreement, which began in 2009.
The revised deal announced Thursday gives Yahoo increased flexibility on how search results are presented on desktops and mobile devices. Yahoo will continue serving ads and results from Microsoft’s Bing search engine for a majority of its desktop search traffic.
The economic provisions of the deal remain unchanged, the companies said in their announcement.

993,"March 22, 2015",China: Microsoft offers Windows for free after threat of antitrust probe,"
Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, on March 18-19 held its WinHEC meeting in China’s Shenzhen, aiming to display its free Windows 10 operating system.
The offer of the free OS is likely the result of a compromise with Chinese authorities after several raids of Microsoft’s China offices last year by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce for “antitrust violations.”
“The Windows 10 upgrade will bring with us a very good opportunity to give clients and users a very good experience,” said Terry Myerson, vice president of Microsoft’s operating system division.Microsoft hopes to earn profits from additional applications, offered on the free OS, said Myerson.

According to reports from Nikkei and Chinese state media, the company will be shutting down a pair of plants – one in Beijing and one in Dongguan. As well as moving some of the equipment to Vietnam. Those closures translate to about 9,000 job cuts.
The Chinese state-run media accused Microsoft of having backdoors in its products that would enable U.S. spying, and the company is currently undergoing an antitrust probe from Chinese regulators.

995,"February 19, 2015",Refusal to License as an Abuse of Market Dominance – From Commercial Solvents to Microsoft,"
Posted by Social Science Research Network
 Refusal to License as an Abuse of Market Dominance – From Commercial Solvents to Microsoft –  Matthias Lamping (Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition)
Abstract: Although intellectual property rights do not automatically confer a dominant market position, they may put the right holder in the position to behave more or less independently of its competitors, customers and ultimately of its consumers. The extent of that relative immunity from competition depends on a number of factors, from the specific characteristics of the protected subject-matter through to the structure of the relevant market. In extreme cases, an intellectual property right will constitute an “essential facility” and therefore enable the right holder to control access to, and thus competition in, the market. In such cases, a refusal to license may lead to an abuse of market dominance within the meaning of Article 102 TFEU. Depending on the circumstances of the case, the abuse may consist in a discrimination of trading partners, an unjustified foreclosure of competitors, a negligence of market needs or an expansion of market power to another related market. However, a compulsory license will not always be the appropriate remedy to stop the established abuse, its anti-competitive effects, and its recurrence. In principle, the European Commission asks the dominant company to cease and desist from the abusive conduct, but it does not grant compulsory licenses.

This paper examines the approach taken by the Commission in assessing under the EU Merger Control Regulation (EUMR) the competition impact of mergers in high technology markets in the recent Microsoft/Skype, and Facebook/WhatsApp merger cases.

998,"January 12, 2015",South Korea: Samsung future in hands of Microsoft royalty spat outcome,"
Samsung is reportedly mulling a new partnership with Microsoft, a curious business move for the South Korean firm considering it is still in the midst of a patent dispute with the US computer giant.
According to reports, Samsung is looking to loosen its dependence on Google’s Android mobile operating system and possibly look towards Microsoft’s Windows 8.1 system when manufacturing smartphones, according to unnamed sources.
One unnamed official told reporters that “Samsung has run pilot programs on the stability of Windows 8.1 software on devices. It is interested in promoting Windows mobiles.”
But Samsung’s ongoing patent licensing dispute with Microsoft presents a major hurdle for Samsung’s potential new Windows phones. The companies secured an agreement several years ago that saw Microsoft obtain licensing royalties from Samsung.
Samsung, however, argues that Microsoft nullified their agreement when it acquired Nokia’s handset operations, placing Microsoft in direct competition with Samsung. Microsoft has since filed a lawsuit against Samsung to recover $1 billion in royalty fees.
Reports say Samsung is still fighting for antitrust authorities in the US, China and South Korea to nullify the Nokia acquisition.

999,"December 18, 2014",EU: Microsoft ends implementation of 2009 landmark antitrust concessions,"
Five years after EU authorities forced Microsoft to display a browser choice screen for its consumers as part of a landmark antitrust ruling, reports say the company has pulled the plug on the screen.
The European Commission demanded Microsoft show the screen to allow users to choose which browser to use, an order that was part of a settlement reached with the company following an investigation into allegations that Microsoft’s tying of Internet Explorer with Windows was anticompetitive. The settlement was reached in 2009.
The screen provided download links for rival browsers, including Google Chrome and Apple Safari. It was displayed only in the EU.
Microsoft announced Wednesday that it would retire the screen. In a statement, the company said “the obligations imposed by that decision have expired and as a result the Browser Choice Update will no longer be delivered to new users.
Just last year, the Commission fined Microsoft $732 million for omitting the ballot screen from its Windows 7 Service Pack 1 for 14 months, reports say. Microsoft claimed it was a technical error.
